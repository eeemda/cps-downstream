  abstract = {Government services act as important sites of political socialization. Through interactions with the state individuals learn lessons about their value as citizens, form preferences over government services, and understand the value of political participation. What happens when the private sector replaces government provision of basic services? I explore this question in the context of a randomized private school voucher experiment in India. Based on an original household survey of 1,200 households, and semi-structured interviews conducted five years after the voucher lottery, I find that voucher winning households hold stronger market-oriented beliefs. However, voucher winning households show little difference in political participation on most measures of political participation. I argue that these results are driven by a greater comfort with private providers as permanent economic actors. This suggests exposure to different economic actors, in the form of private schools, have the potential to change political preferences.},

The PERI studies explore privatisation of education or more specifically, the establishment and operation of private schools and the direct and indirect process of privatising which results from the increased role of private actors in the provision of education. The PERI studies were analysed using a detailed framework derived from international human rights legal standards, including non-discrimination, educational freedoms, the best interests of the child,2 and the 4A framework, which corresponds to the essential features of the right to education \textendash{} Availability, Accessibility, Acceptability and Adaptability. The PERI studies serve as case studies of the growing global trends of privatisation and its resulting human rights impacts, but this report will not provide an analysis of each research piece or on the individual countries that were the subjects of the PERI studies. This report does not seek to be a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of privatisation on education or on human rights in general, and it is deliberately limited in scope},

  abstract = {Much of the debate over school choice has focused on how voucher systems and charter schools affect the quality of public education. But should American education really be subjected to market forces? What is the significance of this decision for American democracy? The great hope of the school choice movement is that the introduction of market forces will make for more efficient and responsive public educational institutions. Parents become customers, and public schools become firms that compete for these customers on the open market. But, as Scott Abernathy crucially reminds us, parents are much more than customers. They are also citizens who help shape educational policy at bake sales and budget meetings, in teacher conferences and political campaigns. Abernathy challenges the assumption that public schools will necessarily improve when subjected to market-based reforms, raising instead the alarming possibility that such changes will produce a national anti-system of isolated and disconnected schools. School Choice and the Future of American Democracy shows how school choice breaks open the boundaries of a once-closed system, allowing the parents who are most involved in their children's education to leave the public schools for private or charter institutions. Poor schools are most hurt by this drain of civic engagement. When we privatize the customer relationship in education, we risk privatizing the very foundations of our citizenship.}

The authors contribute to recent advances in the literature that have highlighted the role of economic threat for understanding the support of radical-right parties. In contrast to existing work, the authors do not treat voters as atomistic individuals; they instead investigate households as a crucial site of preference formation. Combining largescale labor market data with comparative survey data, they confirm the expectations of their theoretical framework by demonstrating that the effect of occupational unemployment risk on radical-right support is strongly conditioned by household-risk constellations. Voting for the radical right is a function not only of a voter's own risk, but also of his or her partner's risk. The article provides additional evidence on the extent to which these effects are gendered and on the mechanisms that link household risk and party choice. The results imply that much of the existing literature on individual risk exposure potentially underestimates its effect on political behavior due to the neglect of multiplier effects within households.},

Tertiary education is the most important form of spending, and most educational spending is performed for 18- to 23-year-old individuals. More educated and wealthier household heads spend more in the education of household members. Households with both parents present and those with a female main income provider spend more than their counterparts. Urban households also spend more than rural households. On average, education in Latin America and the Caribbean is a luxury good, whereas it may be a necessity in the United States. No gender bias is found in primary education, but at secondary school age and up households invest more in females than in males.},

Using a unique panel data set assembled from official social audit reports, we study the impact of audits on programme irregularities and employment generation during MGNREGA implementation in Andhra Pradesh. Within a dynamic conceptual framework where beneficiaries, auditors and transgressors interact and learn and where beneficiary stakes vary across programme outcome and irregularity types, we find a positive but insignificant impact of audits on employment generation. We also find a modest decline in complaints related to non-availability of work and in the leakage amount per labour related irregularity: outcomes with high beneficiary stakes. The latter occur alongside an increase in {$\twolowline$}harder to detect` material-related irregularities with lower beneficiary stakes. We find evidence suggestive of beneficiary {$\twolowline$}learning` from audit participation and of audit effectiveness in detecting irregularities. In contrast, the impact of repeated audits in deterring irregularities are mostly absent, and highlight the need for a time bound process where transgressors are punished and responsibilities for follow up of social audit findings are laid out and credibly enforced.},

These models, especially those embodying the bargaining approach, provide a useful framework for analyzing gender relations and throwing some light on how gender asymmetries are constructed and contested. At the same time, the models have paid inadequate or no attention to some critical aspects of intra-household gender dynamics, such as: What factors (especially qualitative ones) affect bargaining power? What is the role of social norms and social perceptions in the bargaining process and how might these factors themselves be bargained over? Are women less motivated than men by self-interest and might this affect bargaining outcomes? Most discussions on bargaining also say little about gender relations beyond the household, and about the links between extra-household and intra-household bargaining power. This paper spells out the nature of these complexities and their importance in determining the outcomes of intra-household dynamics. It also extends the bargaining approach beyond the household to the interlinked arenas of the market, the community and the State.},

By not examining informal workers as a class ``in themselves,'' we are losing insights into how they are translating their posi- tions into a class ``for themselves.'' As a consequence, the recent literature on global- ization and liberalization is increasingly concluding that the decreasing proportion of formally employed workers (and the subsequent rise in informal employment) the world over signifies a decline in all class-based organization. Such arguments have obscured our understanding of the current social dynamics of exploitation and resistance. In an attempt to begin filling this gap, this article recovers class as an im- portant analytical tool with which to examine (1) the current relations of power be- tween the state, employers, and the majority of India's workers, and (2) how the structures of production within which informal workers operate affect their collec- tive action strategies. A reformulated labor movement model is offered to expose the underlying mechanisms through which informal workers translate their loca- tion in the class structure as a class ``in itself '' into a political group as a class ``for it- self.'' Insights into how informal workers organize can have profound implications for our understanding of changing state-labor relations as national governments at- tempt to liberalize their economies and simultaneously rein in their welfare functions.},

Contrary to mobilizations in the for- mal sector, those workers do not make direct demands on their employers. Instead they appeal to the state to obtain welfare benefits. The study shows that neolib- eral reform has surprisingly opened up new channels for informal workers to constitute themselves as a class. This represents an amendment to earlier analyses that focused exclusively on the mobilizing capacity of work- ers in the formal sector.

This article examines how the eclipsing role of the state in labor protection has affected state\textendash labor relations. In particular, it analyzes collective action strategies among India's growing mass of informally employed workers, who do not receive secure wages or benefits from either the state or their employer. In response to the recent changes in state policies, I find that informal workers have had to alter their organizing strategies in ways that are reshaping the social contract between state and labor. Rather than demanding employers for workers' benefits, they are making direct demands on the state for welfare benefits. To attain state attention, informal workers are using the rhetoric of citizenship rights to offer their unregulated labor and political support in return for state recognition of their work. Such recognition bestows informal workers with a degree of social legitimacy, thereby dignifying their discontent and bolstering their status as claim makers in their society. These findings offer a reformulated model of state\textendash labor relations that focuses attention on the qualitative, rather than quantitative, nature of the nexus; encompasses a dynamic and inter-dependent conceptualization of state and labor; and accommodates the creative and diverse strategies of industrial relations being forged in the contemporary era.},

Recently the interest in good governance, the quality of government, and similar concepts has increased considerably.However, despite this increasing interest and use, an adequate definition of the concept of quality of government has proved difficult to find. This article criticizes recent attempts at such a definition and proposes an alternative, more complex definition that includes moral content and also encompasses a plurality of values and virtues at its core. An acceptable definition of the quality of governance must be consistent with the demands of a public ethos, the virtues of good decision making and reason giving, the rule of law, efficiency, stability, and a principle of beneficence. The article describes these components in detail and the relations among them. I},

The poor say they turn out to vote because it is their right while the non-poor report they vote because they expect material benefits from the state, some kind of access to the state, or because voting is their civic duty. We attribute the different reasons for voting offered by the poor and non-poor to their different relationships with the state. Unlike the non-poor, the poor mostly report the state mistreats or ignores them yet makes every effort on Election Day to ensure they are treated equally. The recognition the state grants to the poor on Election Day leads them to view voting as a valued right, one that gives them a rare chance to associate with those who govern as equals. The evidence in this paper was drawn from 30 focus groups with a total of 445 participants and 150 open-ended interviews conducted across Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh and three state and national-level surveys.},

We interpret the decisions of political parties to enlist known criminals as candidates as a function of the capacity of these candidates to intimidate voters. To substantiate this, we show that criminal candidates depress electoral turnout. In addition, our results suggest that India's well-known incumbency disadvantage stems from the superior electoral performance of allegedly criminal candidates, who drive parliamentary incumbents from office. Our study raises questions for democratic theory, which claims that electoral competition improves accountability, and for the future of the Indian polity, which is experiencing a growing criminalization of the national political arena.},

Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative account- ability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, adminis- trative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transpar- ency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally.},

To assess the effects of disparate choice policies on segregation, we replicate this analysis for magnet schools, which have admissions practices intended to increase diversity, and find no evidence that magnet enrollment growth increases segregation.},

A theory of the distribution of responsibility, combining insights from the political economy of development and the study of mass behaviour, is presented. Evidence from seventeen Latin American countries shows that citizens often blame policy outcomes on international and private-sector actors, to which they, as voters, have no direct recourse. Ties to world markets and the International Monetary Fund, especially foreign debt, shift responsibility towards international actors and tend to exonerate national politicians.},

This study, carried out as part of a new multi-country survey project, is the first systematic investigation in Peru into the extent and causes of teachers' absence from schools. Data from our nationally representative survey of public primary schools, based on unannounced visits and direct observation of teachers, reveals that public school teachers in Peru are absent from their posts 11 percent of the time. While this overall absence rate is low compared with those of other survey countries, the absence rates in Peru's poorest and remotest communities are much higher\textemdash 16 and 21 percent, respectively. In our multivariate analysis of the causes of public school teacher absence, we identify several important variables that are associated with increased absence: poor working conditions, such as poorer communities and infrastructure; teachers with fewer ties to the school's community; contract teaching; and, perhaps, an absence of private competition. By contrast, proxies for more vigorous top-down and bottom-up monitoring are not associated with lower absence. These results, together with the relatively high overall public school teacher attendance rates in an environment where financial incentives for performance are weak, suggest that non-pecuniary incentives are important determinants of teacher performance.},

Yet, there is a lack of evidence to date on their role in reducing inequalities: namely, the extent to which private schooling improves learning among the most disadvantaged children. Our paper uses household survey data from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda to identify whether any observed impact of private schooling on core literacy and numeracy skills differs according to children's household wealth. We demonstrate wealth gaps in access to private schooling, and use inferential models to account for observable differences between those who do and do not enrol in private schools. In Kenya and Uganda, we find that private schooling appears to improve the chances of children learning relative to their peers in government schools, but the chances of the poorest children learning in private schools remains low and is at best equivalent to the richest learning in government schools. In Tanzania, private schooling does not seem to improve poorer children's learning, whereas it does for richer children. These findings raise a caution about the extent to which private provision can help narrow learning inequalities.},

Research drawing on the case of China's special economic zones suggests that subnational polities can target the location of export zones in order to catalyze local and regional socioeconomic development. Since 2006, a number of Indian states have pushed forward similar zones in the face of accusations of land grabbing, arguing that the zones will be engines for improvement in exports, employment, and infrastructure. I argue that local development spillovers are an important, albeit previously understudied, dimension by which to evaluate the effects of special economic zones. I then present the first systematic analysis of the developmental effects of India's SEZs, leveraging an original dataset on their locations, together with 2001 and 2011 census data containing a host of social and economic developmental variables. The findings show these SEZs have failed to bring about local socioeconomic development. To explain this absence of developmental spillovers, I provide a theoretical framework based on the crucial role of political economy incentive structures facing local politicians. I outline the mechanism through which Indian state politicians use state-owned development corporations for rent capture, undermining the potential effectiveness of SEZs and leading to their developmental failures. The combination of available means for extracting rents and the limited political constraints on such rent extraction leads to a lack of developmental spillovers. This framework can also help to explain the difference in the effects of SEZs in India and in China. These findings have theoretical importance for understanding the conditions under which subnational polities can use export zones and other export policies to catalyze development, and practical implications for understanding the mixed pattern of SEZ success across the world.},

We also propose an informal way to assess selectivity bias based on measuring the ratio of selection on unobservables to selection on observables that would be required if one is to attribute the entire effect of Catholic school attendance to selection bias.We use our methods to estimate the effect of attending a Catholic high school on a variety of outcomes. Our main conclusion is that Catholic high schools substantially increase the probability of graduating from high school and, more tentatively, attending college.

This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys. These conclusions, which have appeared ambiguous when using ``naive'' estimators that fail to adjust for multiple testing, contribute to a growing literature on the emerging female\textendash male academic achievement gap. They also demonstrate that in complex studies where multiple questions are asked of the same data set, it can be important to declare the family of tests under consideration and to either consolidate measures or report adjusted and unadjusted p values},

Second, we discuss organizing the logical structure of an analysis plan into a gated tree that directs type I error towards these high-powered tests. In simulations we show that researchers may prefer these "optimus gates" across a wide range of data-generating processes. We then assess our strategy using the community-driven development (CDD) application from Casey et al. (2012) and the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment from Finkelstein et al. (2012). We find substantial power gains in both applications, meaningfully changing the conclusions of Casey et al. (2012).},

  abstract = {During the last decade, enrollments in private schools exploded in a number of low-income countries. In both India and Pakistan, for example, private schools, the majority of which operate as small-scale, low cost enterprises without any regulatory oversight or government subsidies, now account for more than 20 percent of all primary enrollments. The environment that these schools operate in and their increasing importance offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the benefits (or lack thereof) of a pure market model of educational provision with no government regulation or subsidies. Using an instrumental variables approach together with data from Pakistan, we show that test-scores of children in private schools are 0.8 to 1 standard deviation higher (depending on the subject) than those of their public school counterparts. Further, public schools are not better at promoting better civic values; if anything, children in private schools are better informed about Pakistan, are more "pro-democratic," and exhibit lower gender biases. These results question the oft-posited trade-off between private schooling and ideology. Given that the cost of educating a child in a public school is 2 to 5 times as much as in a private school, they also argue for rethinking the fundamental model of how to deliver education in low-income settings.},

In an environmentwith lowfemale education andmobility, GSSs substantially increase the local supply of skilled women lowering wages locally and allowing the market to offer affordable education. These findings highlight the prominent role of women as teachers in facilitating educational access and resonate with similar historical evidence from developed economies.

We examine why school systems varied between countries and over time, concentrating on three institutional dimensions: centralization, secularization, and subsidization. There were two paths to centralization: through liberal and social democratic governments in democracies, or through fascist and conservative parties in autocracies. We find that the secularization of public school systems can be explained by path-dependent state-church relationships (countries with established national churches were less likely to have secularized education systems) but also by partisan politics. Finally, we find that the provision of public funding to private providers of education, especially to private religious schools, can be seen as a solution to religious conflict, since such institutions were most common in countries where Catholicism was a significant but not entirely dominant religion.},

Yet political economists have had little to say about how this critical phenomenon affects citizens' welfare and their demands from government. This article develops a novel the- oretical argument linking housing prices to social policy preferences and policy outcomes. I argue that homeowners experiencing house price appreciation will become less supportive of redistribution and social insurance policies since increased house prices both increase individuals' permanent income and the value of housing as self-supplied insurance against income loss. Political parties of the right will, responding to these preferences, cut social spending substantially during housing booms. I test these propositions using both microdata on social preferences from panel surveys in the USA, the UK, and a cross-country survey of 29 countries, and macrodata of national social spending for 18 countries between 1975 and 2001},

Liberals, Catholics, conservatives, socialists, and fascists all fought bitterly over both the provision and political control of public services, with profound consequences for contemporary political developments. Integrating data on the historical development of public order, education, and public health with novel measures on the ideological orientation of governments, the authors provide a wealth of new evidence on a missing link in the history of the modern state.},

However, for a number of practical reasons, researchers are sometimes unable to conduct experiments and must rely on observational data. In an effort to develop estimators that can approximate experimental results using observational data, scholars have given increasing attention to matching. In this article, we test the performance of matching by gauging the success with which matching approximates experimental results. The voter mobilization experiment presented here comprises a large number of observations (60,000 randomly assigned to the treatment group and nearly two million assigned to the control group) and a rich set of covariates. This study is analyzed in two ways. The first method, instrumental variables estimation, takes advantage of random assignment in order to produce consistent estimates. The second method, matching estimation, ignores random assignment and analyzes the data as though they were nonexperimental. Matching is found to produce biased results in this application because even a rich set of covariates is insufficient to control for preexisting differences between the treatment and control group. Matching, in fact, produces estimates that are no more accurate than those generated by ordinary least squares regression. The experimental findings show that brief paid get-out-the-vote phone calls do not increase turnout, while matching and regression show a large and significant effect.},

Specifically, causal effects estimated via multiple regression differentially weight each unit's contribution. The ``effective sample'' that regression uses to generate the causal effect estimate may bear little resemblance to the pop- ulation of interest. The effects that multiple regression estimate may be nonrepresentative in a similar manner as are effects produced via quasi-experimental methods such as instru- mental variables, matching, or regression discontinuity designs, implying there is no general external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on representative samples over quasi- experimental methods. We show how to estimate the implied multiple-regression weights for each unit, thus allowing researchers to visualize the characteristics of the effective sample. We then discuss alternative approaches that, under certain conditions, recover representative average causal effects. The requisite conditions cannot always be met.},

  abstract = {Part of the debate on the impact of privatisation in and of education lies in determining against which standards of evidence should the phenomenon be assessed. The questions `what impacts of privatisation in education are we measuring?' and its corollary `what education system do we wish to have?' are crucial to determining the response. Hence, some of the disagreements surrounding the analysis of empirical evidence on privatisation in education come from differences in the normative framework chosen. Some may, for instance, give a higher weight to equality and equity concerns, while others will consider choice as a structural principle. These disagreements have fundamental implications as to how research is done, interpreted, and used by policy makers, in particular in the Global South where the issues are especially acute. How can we reflect on these key disagreements? This article contends that human rights law, and in particular international human rights standards, as a universally agreed legal normative framework, must be considered and should be a cardinal reference to reflect on privatisation in education, and can provide a useful tool to provide a third way to reflect on this polarised debate. This stems in part from the fact that all countries in the world are party to one or more international treaties protecting the right to education and are thus legally bound to enforce it. However, the human rights framework contains inner tensions, that give it richness, but also require analysis to be able to use it. On one hand, it guarantees the right to mandatory and free quality education for all without discrimination, requiring that education systems `do not lead to extreme disparities of educational opportunity for some groups in society at the expense of others', while on the other hand, it provides for the liberty of parents to choose or establish a private school\textemdash which may be a source of inequality. This paper gives a preliminary assessment of this tension by providing an overview of what we know of the normative human rights framework, as a first step towards a broader project aiming at developing comprehensive guidelines unpacking the normative framework on the right to education relevant to privatisation. It is hoped that this preliminary assessment can help to reflect on some of the fundamental debates with regards to the effect of privatisation of education in the Global South.},

Our estimates suggest that several empirical patterns reported in previous work deserve a second look. We find that trade openness has a positive association with education and social security expenditures, that financial openness does not constrain government outlays for social programs, and that democracy has a strong positive association with social spending, particularly on items that bolster human capital formation.},

We control for prior achievement at the secondary level (at the end of tenth-grade) to estimate the value added of a teacher over a two year course, and define a good teacher as one who consistently gets higher achievement for students. In addition to the prior achievement, we exploit the fact that students took exams in multiple subjects during their senior secondary exam to control for pupil fixed effects. We find a considerable variability in teacher effectiveness over a two year course \textendash{} a one standard deviation improvement in teacher quality adds 0.38 standard deviation points in students score. Furthermore, consistent with studies in the US, we find that although teacher quality matters, the observed characteristics explain little of the variability in teacher quality.},

This note attempts to identify and analyze what the key policy reform measures and the public investment requirements might be in order to attain some of the critical objectives of the NCMP. In terms of the thrust areas highlighted in the NCMP, focusing on rural development \textendash{} agriculture, infrastructure, R \& D, agro-based industries and higher public spending in health and education are the most prominent ones. At the heart of the NCMP is the following assessment. India's poverty reduction must be built on two pillars: rapid economic growth and targeted investments aimed at the poorest of the poor. The rapid economic growth is to be based largely on the private sector, including foreign direct investments into India. Thus, the budget, for example supports many critical areas of market reform and growth promotion, including financial sector deepening, export promotion, liberalization of foreign direct investment. We are of the view that India's rural development would essentially require an agriculture-led growth strategy. In short, the rural development strategy for India may perhaps focus along the following lines - agriculture-led growth as the main area of focus; under which, some of the key objectives may be: a) Productivity improvements, including agricultural extension, research and development, and crop diversification; b) Bringing in larger areas under irrigation so as to reduce monsoon dependence; c) Enhanced focus on agricultural exports, and much greater focus on building up rural infrastructure, with specific focus on power, roads, and availability of safe drinking water. Just as in China, a careful balance will have to be struck between two kinds of investments in the rural hinterland (e.g. in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar): physical infrastructure in roads, rail, airports, and telecomms to bring these regions closer to the international markets, and investments in human capital, mainly education and health, to raise the productivity of the rural population. The latter investments may end up attracting jobs to the interior, eager to benefit from an increasingly skilled labor force; or it may provoke large-scale migration to more economical coastal regions. Either way, however, the currently impoverished populations would benefit from rising living standards, wherever in India they are enjoyed.},

However, recent advances in econometric theory show that such designs are likely to be biased in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity. Given the pronounced use of staggered treatment designs in accounting and applied corporate finance research, this finding potentially impacts a large swath of prior findings in these fields. We survey the nascent literature and document how and when such bias arises from treatment effect heterogeneity. We then apply recently proposed methods to a set of prior published results. We find that correcting for the bias induced by the staggered nature of policy adoption frequently impacts the estimated effect from standard difference-in-difference studies. In many cases, the reported effects in prior research become indistinguishable from zero.},

The existing literature suggests that coercion and personal obligations underpin this form of clientelism, causing voters to support candidates for reasons tangential to political performance. However, voters who support candidates preferred by local patrons may be making sophisticated political inferences. Inmany developing countries, elected politicians need toworkwith local patrons to deliver resources to voters, giving voters good reason to consider their patron's opinions of candidates. This argument is tested using data from an original survey of traditional chiefs and an experiment involving voters in Zambia. Chiefs and politicians with stronger relationships collaborate more effectively to provide local public goods. Furthermore, voters are particularly likely to vote with their chief if they perceive the importance of chiefs and politicians working jointly for local development.},

Recent research sug- gests that many colonial interventions in Africa ``locked in'' changes to societies, with initial effects persisting over many decades. However, although mission schools have had long-term consequences for the communities in which they were based, these effects have swung in dif- ferent directions during different periods of time. Drawing on a new data set, this paper shows that mission schools initially had a dramatic impact on the status of ethnic groups. Groups in weaker positions due to the slave trade were particularly likely to access missionary education early in the 20th century, and they were able to use these opportunities to gain employment and economic status in the late colonial period/early post-independence period. However, 50 years later, the fortune of many of these groups has reversed again. During the past half century, groups that received early access to missionary education have become economically disadvan- taged in many sectors.},

Many of the changes are the result of deliberate policy, often under the banner of ``educational reform'' and their impact can be far- reaching, for the education of students, for equity, for the conditions of teach- ers and other educational personnel. Other changes may be introduced un- announced: changes in the way schools are run which may be presented as ``keeping up with the times'', but in reality reflect an increasingly market- based, competitive and consumerist orientation in our societies. In both cases, the trend towards privatization of public education is hidden. It is camouflaged by the language of ``educational reform'', or introduced stealthily as ``modernization''. Hence the title for this study: HIDDEN PRIVATI- SATION IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. The purpose of this study is to get the trend towards privatization out into the light of day. We need greater transparency, we need to get a better under- standing of what is happening, so that we can engage in an open public debate about the future of education in our societies.

The data show that the shares of the top 0.01 percent, 0.1 percent, and 1 percent in total income shrank substantially from the 1950s to the early to mid-1980s but then rose again, so that today these shares are only slightly below what they were in the 1920s and 1930s. This U-shaped pattern is broadly consistent with the evolution of economic policy in India: From the 1950s to the early to mid-1980s was a period of ``socialist'' policies in India, whereas the subsequent period, starting with the rise of Rajiv Gandhi, saw a gradual shift toward more probusiness policies. Although the initial share of the top income group was small, the fact that the rich were getting richer had a nontrivial impact on the overall income distribution. Although the impact is not large enough to fully explain the gap observed during the 1990s between average consumption growth shown in National Sample Survey\textendash based data and the national accounts\textendash based data, it is sufficiently large to explain a nonnegligible part of it (20\textendash 40 percent).},

However, critics have pointed out that a potential constraint in this agenda is that results from small ``proof-of-concept'' studies run by nongovernment organizations may not apply to policies that can be implemented by governments on a large scale. After discussing the potential issues, this paper describes the journey from the original concept to the design and evaluation of scalable policy. We do so by evaluating a series of strategies that aim to integrate the nongovernment organization Pratham's ``Teaching at the Right Level'' methodology into elementary schools in India. The methodology consists of reorganizing instruction based on children's actual learning levels, rather than on a prescribed syllabus, and has previously been shown to be very effective when properly implemented. We present evidence from randomized controlled trials involving some designs that failed to produce impacts within the regular schooling system but still helped shape subsequent versions of the program. As a result of this process, two versions of the programs were developed that successfully raised children's learning levels using scalable models in government schools. We use this example to draw general lessons about using randomized control trials to design scalable policies.},

In the first, poor voters seek to increase their current income by taxing the rich, and social policy serves to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. In the second account, voters seek social insurance against future job loss, and social policy serves as an insurance mechanism rather than a redistributive one. Both of these accounts share the assumption that voters can clearly distinguish between the redis- tributive and insurance elements of public policy and, therefore, that individ- ual-level characteristics (income, labor market risks) systematically shape preferences over social policy. Our goal is to examine the soundness of that behavioral assumption. We do so with a laboratory experiment that involves economic production, voting on taxation and fiscal transfers. We treat sub- jects with social policies that vary in their level of redistribution and insur- ance to examine how this impacts their preferred tax rate. We complement},

Furthermore, it examines changes in key family outcomes, such as the rise of female labor force participation, the decline in marriage, and the increase in divorce. These changes have been accompanied by and interact with cultural change. Finally, we show how cultural institutions related to the family, such as son preference, co-residence traditions, polygyny, and marriage payments, affect decision-making within the family and interact with policy. We conclude that studying the family in a vacuum, without accounting for the role of culture, may lead to misleading conclusions regarding the effects of policies, macroeconomic shocks, or technological change.},

Controlling for observable personal characteristics and school selection, we find that graduates of private secondary schools perform better in the labor market. This is contrary to the widely held belief, in Indonesia, that public secondary schools are superior. Our findings, coupled with the existing literature on private school cognitive and cost advantages, suggest the need for greater private participation in the education sector.},

Especially prevalent in times of political gridlock or stasis, policy drift is a useful concept for capturing how inaction can gradually diminish the effectiveness of social programmes over time. By highlighting cases of difficult-to-see policy inaction, however, Hacker's concept sets a high bar for empirical scholarship. In this article, we suggest that analyzing policy drift requires attention to comparative policy outcomes, the implementation of reforms intended to alleviate drift, and the time frame of the study. With these insights in mind, we analyze the impact of drift on US retirement security and health care coverage to reflect policy changes that have occurred since Hacker's original analysis was published.},

The fundamental barrier to success turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods, explains how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations. Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents, much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that: a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely to be suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen when targets are ``hard,'' i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and insurgency.},

Of the alternatives, ``non-state market driven'' (NSMD) governance systems deserve greater attention because they offer the strongest regulation and potential to socially embed global markets. NSMD systems encourage compliance by recognizing and tracking, along the market's supply chain, responsi- bly produced goods and services. They aim to establish ``political legitimacy'' whereby firms, social actors, and stakeholders are united into a community that accepts ``shared rule as appro- priate and justified.'' Drawing inductively on evidence from a range of NSMD systems, and deductively on theories of institutions and learning, we develop an analytical framework and a preliminary set of causal propositions to explicate whether and how political legitimacy might be achieved. The framework corrects the existing literature's inattention to the condi- tioning effects of global social structure, and its tendency to treat actor evaluations of NSMD systems as static and strategic. It identifies a three-phase process through which NSMD systems might gain political legitimacy. It posits that a ``logic of consequences'' alone cannot explain actor evaluations: the explanation requires greater reference to a ``logic of appropriateness'' as systems progress through the phases. The framework aims to guide future empirical work to assess the potential of NSMD systems to socially embed global markets.},

We first set out a basic definition of state capacity, distinguishing it from other related concepts and definitions in the social science literature. We then present an objective new measure, the State Capacity Index (SCI), which evaluates state agencies on three axes: career strength, agency career specialization, and politicization. We conclude with some preliminary tests of the measure`s utility in analyzing agency level capacity in Brazil, with specific reference to the literature on corruption and accountability.}

Depending on precisely how the legislature behaves, the result may be excessive public spending or allocations of public goods characterized by uncertainty and misallocation across districts. The extent of the conflict of interest between districts is affected by spillovers and differences in tastes for public spending. Thus, the relative performance of centralized and decentralized systems depends upon spillovers and differences in tastes for public spending, but for different reasons than sugested in the existing literature},

  abstract = {Rapid school expansion in India and much of the developing world has had to contend with limited financial resources and poor accountability measures. Allocating limited resources across competing uses is itself difficult, but when these resources are misused and political pressures undermine educational accountability mechanisms, universal schooling programs are severely compromised. Without exception, the poor suffer the most. In this dissertation, I examine two accountability problems \textemdash{} widespread teacher absenteeism and the manipulation of teacher transfers \textemdash{} in government schools in India, and how these are influenced by political factors. I use representative primary data from 2350 government schoolteachers in seven district-level teacher labor markets in India to describe the mechanism of the power play between teachers and politicians, its frequency and importance. My data suggest that strategic linkages between teachers and politicians potentially complicate policy attempts at influencing teacher accountability. I supplement the analysis using secondary data from a large nationally representative dataset on teacher absence. I find evidence that teachers who are politically active are also more likely to be absent. This lends support to the theory that at least some teachers believe they can get away with absences because they are protected by powerful connections. The manipulation of transfers suggests another type of accountability breach because it involves the circumvention of formal rules. I find evidence to suggest that transfers are typically characterized by informal transactions between teachers on the one hand, and politicians, bureaucrats, or politically-connected people on the other. This undermines the ability of the system to function along professional lines and official criteria. The problems of teacher absenteeism and the manipulation of teacher transfers suggest that teacher accountability in India needs to be understood as a structural problem. The problems of teacher absenteeism and manipulation of transfers might appear intractable, but this is partly because there is very little large-scale data documenting and examining the situation. This dissertation addresses this gap by analyzing the mutual interdependence between teachers, government officials, and bureaucrats in seven teacher labor markets using recently collected data. It develops new insights on the relation of politics and power to teacher accountability, thereby providing a more complete and nuanced understanding of political economy factors that need to be addressed if we seek to reform public schools in India. vi},

Remedial measures in terms of devising suitable derivate instruments, increasing reliance on the corporate debt market, expanding the reach of the mutual funds industry and better corporate governance and accounting standards are proposed so as to instil buoyancy in the sector},

Rural non-farm self-employment is especially dynamic with farm households diversifying into the sector to increase income. The bottling up of labour in rural areas means that farm sizes will continue to decline, agriculture will continue its trend to feminisation, and part-time farming will become the dominant farm model.},

Since the early 1990s, the focus has been primarily on pro-poor growth, with the ``poor'' being people living on less than \$1 day, or in some regions \$2 day. The idea of pro-poor growth emerged in the early 1990s as a counterpoint to a concern with growth alone (measured in per-capita income) and is generally defined as growth which benefits the poor as much or more than the rest of the population. Examples include conditional cash transfers, which target the poor while minimizing the fiscal burden on the public sector, and donors' emphasizing primary over higher education as an assured way to benefit the poor while investing in long-term growth through increases in human capital. Yet these pro-poor, inclusive policies are not necessarily without tradeoffs in fostering long-run growth. In this paper I argue that the concept of inclusive growth should go beyond the traditional emphasis on the poor (and the rest) and take into account changes in the size and economic command of the group conventionally defined as neither poor nor rich, i.e., the middle class.},

The authors suggest plurality parties' objectives to demonstrate inclusive- ness outweigh the concern over policy distance. They test their hypotheses on a sample of all electorally active ethnic minorities in democracies from 1945 to 2004. The authors find support for their hypothesis that ethnic par- ties representing minorities that diverge in religious family from the majority are more likely to be included in governing coalitions than are ethnic minori- ties at large. It is interesting, however, that they also find that minority parties representing ethnic groups that differ in denomination from the majority are less likely to be included in governing coalitions.},

Drawing on 20 months of participant observation with survey research projects (2005, 2007-2008), I demonstrate how standards govern data collection to protect and reproduce demographers' shared expectations of "high-quality data." Data are expected to be "clean," accurate and precise, data collection efficient and timely, and data collected from sufficiently large, pure, and representative samples. I employ ethnographic analysis to show that each of these expectations not only guides survey research fieldwork but also produces categories, identities, and practices that reinforce and challenge these standardizing values.},

Many researchers, however, have used a simple difference-in-means estimator, which prevents the efficient examination of multivariate relationships between respondents' characteristics and their responses to sensitive items. Moreover, no systematic means exists to investigate the role of underlying assumptions. We fill these gaps by developing a set of new statistical methods for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked assumptions, propose new multivariate regression estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial prejudice. Open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

Jaimie Bleck explores the effect of this expanded access to education by analyzing the relationship between parents' and students' respective experiences with schooling and their current participation in politics. In a nation characterized both by the declining quality of public education and by a growing number of accredited private providers, does education contribute substantially to the political knowledge and participation of its citizens? Are all educational institutions (public and private, Islamic and secular) equally capable of shaping democratic citizens? Education and Empowered Citizenship in Mali is informed by Bleck's original survey of one thousand citizens, which she conducted in Mali before the 2012 coup d'\'etat, along with exit polls and interviews with parents, students, and educators. Her results demonstrate conclusively that education of any type plays an important role in empowering citizens as democratic agents. Simply put, students know more about politics than peers who have not attended school. Education also appears to bolster participation of parents. Bleck finds that parents who send their children to public school are more likely to engage in electoral politics than other Malian citizens. Furthermore, Bleck demonstrates that increasing levels of education are associated with increases in more engaged forms of political participation, including campaigning, willingness to run for office, and contacting government officials.},

In contrast, affluent children who exited to the private sector in re- sponse to FPE benefited from a strong, causal effect on their exam performance which is robust to selection on unobserved ability.},

This finding is robust to endogenous sorting of more able pupils into private schools. The magnitude of the effect greatly exceeds the most cost-effective interventions to increase public school performance documented in the literature. Combining household survey and administrative data, we estimate median expenditure per pupil is just \$41 per annum in the private sector, compared to \$84 in government primary schools.},

This paper performs a systematic empirical analysis of the determinants of such dissatisfaction, using survey data from Latinobarometro covering 17 countries over the period 1998- 2008, complemented by country level data on macroeconomic, political, and insti- tutional aspects as well as data on privatization. Dissatisfaction appears to respond to absolute and relative welfare effects, and we find a robust U-shaped effect in term of education and income levels, with individuals in the middle of such distributions being more critical with the outcome of privatizations.},

  author = {Boulding, Carew E.},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines the political effects of NGOs in developing democracies. There is a large and contradictory literature on whether, how, and why NGOs affect politics. Some argue that NGOs are an essential component of a strong civil society necessary for democratic consolidation. Others argue that NGOs are co\- opted by the existing hierarchy of political elites, and politicians claim credit for the services they provide, damaging democratic accountability. I argue that NGOs have systematic effects on politics in two realms: participation and voting behavior. First, I agree with the conventional wisdom that NGOs tend to boost participation of all kinds. However, I argue that \textendash{} particularly in weakly democratic settings \textendash{} NGOs are likely to encourage unconventional means of participation such as demonstrations and protest in addition to more conventional forms such as voting. This is a strong challenge to the common assumption in the literature that NGOs are the bulwark of moderate civil society. Second, I argue that the effects of NGOs on voting behavior are conditional on the size of the jurisdiction in question. Existing work predicts starkly contradictory political effects: Some claim NGOs should help incumbents by providing services for which politicians can claim credit, while others claim they should hurt incumbents by facilitating opposition. I argue that both these effects are possible, but in different contexts. In areas with very small populations, the associational effects of NGOs (their ability to bring people together, air common grievances, and build trust to help solve collective action problems) are much stronger, making it more likely that NGO activity will strengthen opposition politics. In larger population areas, however, the effects of increases in association are relatively much smaller. And, in the more impersonal setting of larger cities, credit\-claiming for NGO services is easier. Thus, NGOs in larger cities are likely to help incumbents, rather than help the opposition. I test my argument and competing hypotheses from the literature using a new approach: an analysis of an original sub\-national dataset comparing municipalities in Bolivia. The dataset includes measures of NGO activity, election returns, and protest, as well as a number of controls, for two time periods, 1999 and 2004.},

The authors argue that both of these effects are possible, depending on the size of a jurisdiction's popula- tion. In smaller populations, the authors hypothesize that NGOs facilitate col- lective action and decrease the ability of an incumbent to claim credit for projects; larger jurisdictions water down the effect of NGOs on collective action and permit incumbents' credit claiming. Strong support is found for hypotheses, using electoral, sociodemographic, and NGO data for all of 314 municipalities in Bolivia.},

Instead, Carew Boulding shows that where democratic institutions are weak, NGOs encourage much more contentious political participation, including demonstrations, riots, and protests. Except in extreme cases of poorly functioning democratic institutions, however, the political protest that results from NGO activity is not generally anti-system or incompatible with democracy - again, as long as democracy is functioning above a minimal level.},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines the impact on the Kenyan state of the explosive growth of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing social services in the country since the early 1990s. While NGOs have been present in Kenya since before independence, their numbers grew 15-fold between 1991 and 2008, from about 400 to over 6,000, and most of their funding now derives from foreign sources. What impact do these organizations have on the state? The dissertation answers this question, examining how service provision in education, healthcare, agriculture and water by internationally-funded NGOs affects the social contract between the state and its citizens, the country's governance, and its administrative capacity. In so doing, it addresses both the theoretical debate on the strength of developing states in a globalized, privatized world, and the practical debate on NGOs' role in bolstering or undermining the state. Four crucial ``elements of stateness'' are examined: territoriality, capacity, governance, and legitimacy. Examining each element in turn, the dissertation finds that NGOs have helped to strengthen the Kenyan state. Territorially, NGOs have extended the reach of the state by providing services in places that the government has been unable to reach, particularly in arid, sparsely populated areas. NGOs have improved state capacity by extending services to sectors or communities for which public agencies do not have adequate resources. This extension can be quite literal, as when NGOs provide fuel or vehicles for civil servants' transportation to outlying areas. NGOs have also become increasingly active partners in governance, helping to formulate national social policies regarding service provision. Government actors often now mimic the tools typically employed by NGOs, calling for participatory development and civic education. This has instigated a slow turn toward more democratic governance processes. Finally, NGOs have increased the legitimacy of the state, as the provision of services lowers popular frustration below the point where citizens might become alienated. Survey research shows, for instance, that citizens associate NGOs' good deeds with local government administration, which often gets credit for bringing NGOs to the community.},

This study tests the hypothesis that the adoption of pension privatization is shaped systematically by an interdependent logic, wherein the decision to privatize pensions in one country is sys- tematically linked to corresponding decisions made by governments in relevant peer nations. Duration analysis with time-varying covariates of data from 59 countries between 1980 and 1999 reveals that the decision to adopt a private pension reform in one country increases systemat- ically as the proportion of peer nations that have adopted correspond- ing measures rises. Importantly, the effect of this peer dynamic varies across groups of nations, with the most powerful impact of peer deci- sions being found among Eastern European and Central Asian nations. Peer dynamics likewise contribute powerfully to the adoption of private pension reforms in Latin America, but do not significantly shape the hazard of privatization among the Organization for Economic Cooper- ation and Development member nations. Even controlling for diffusion mechanisms, the analysis shows that pension reform decisions remain subject to domestic political and economic considerations, including demographic pressures, financial costs and incentives to reform, and constraints delimited by the political institutions in each nation.},

The sta- tistical analysis establishes that poor democracies enroll a larger percent- age of the school-age population than do their authoritarian counter- parts. Models using dichotomous and continuous measures of democracy indicate that the institutions associated with individual rights and electoral competition have an important effect on primary school enrollment. Estimates from a selection bias model that account for edu- cation's impact on democracy corroborate the results. One possible explanation is that democratic politicians, facing electoral pressures, are compelled to provide a minimum level of educational opportunity for their citizens. Democracy is often criticized for its inability to insulate politicians from the demands made by society To the extent that the accumulation of human capital generates economic growth, democracy's inability to withstand popular demands may be an important advantage.

Using advances in machine learning that enable large-scale linkages across datasets, we examine the long-term determinants of sociopolitical behavior through an unprecedented individual-level analysis linking contemporary political records to the 1940 U.S. Census. These linked data allow us to measure the exact residential context of nearly every person in the United States in 1940 and, for men, connect this with the political behavior of those still alive over 70 years later.

Reservations enable clean identification of the impact of representation on enforcing gender-equalizing land inheritance reforms. I find that political representation enables women to secure property rights and ensure that they are upheld. However, backlash occurs when reservations guaranteeing female representation make enforcement of reform credible. Women can reduce this backlash by utilizing female representation to trade traditional monetary dowry for property inheritance and familial responsibilities. This, in turn, reduces the ``cost'' of reform to men. These findings confirm the power of political representation to not only claim economic rights but broaden their acceptance by changing perceptions of parity.},

Why do parties attempt to buy votes when the ballot is secret and people could simply accept campaign handouts and then vote as they wish? We analyze responses to surveys we conducted in Argentina in 2002 and offer answers to these questions. Our findings suggest that vote buying is an effective strategy for mobilizing electoral support among low-income people when parties are able to monitor voters' actions, make reasonably accurate infer- ences about how individuals voted, and credibly threaten to punish voters who defect from the implicit clientelist bargain.

Politicians weigh the expected electoral benefits from providing new goods to citizens against the expected electoral costs of reduced access to corrupt funds because of increased transparency. The author shows that the level of bureaucratic corruption in a state is the best predictor of both when states implement policies promoting computer-enabled services and the number of services made available.

Yet, the majority of analyses are limited in their ability to differentiate between different types of corruption and the variation in these types within a single institutional context. In addition, the literature presents conflicting arguments regarding the relationship between democratic electoral competition and the incentives for corruption. In this paper, I present a new conceptualization of corruption, one that emphasizes the type of transactions and actors involved, to highlight the potential variation in incentives for actors engaged in different types of corruption. I then evaluate the hypothesis that electoral competition, and in particular electoral volatility, can have differing effects on the incentives for corruption, depending on politicians' perceived risks and rewards from rent-seeking. I test these claims in India, where the sub- national institutional context controls for a range of alternative explanations. Using two different measures of corruption, I show that electoral volatility has a strong and positive association with low-level corruption, when politicians are insulated from the risk of discovery. Where politicians are more likely to be exposed for corrupt behavior, however, electoral volatility has a neutral or slightly negative relationship with corruption. These findings emphasize both the need for more disaggregated analyses of the types of corruption and a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which the incentives to retain office can shape political behavior in different settings.},

This dataset includes, for each mission station, the geographic location and its characteristics, as well as the printing-, educational-, and healthrelated investments undertaken by the mission. We show that, within regions close to missions, proximity to a printing press is associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation.},

Using a new dataset on tax revenues for 130 countries between 1792 and 2006, we identify ninety-nine episodes of trade liberalization defined as a large fall in trade tax revenues not accompanied by a decrease in trade. Seven took place before World War One, seven in the interwar period, eighteen in the Bretton Woods period and the remainder after 1970. We examine the extent to which countries were able to recover the tax revenues lost by liberalizing trade by using other sources of revenue. We find that historical (pre-1970) trade liberalization episodes were unlikely to be accompanied by decreases in tax revenues, especially during the Bretton Woods era. In the recent period however, over 40\% of the developing countries in our sample experience a fall in total tax revenues that lasts more than ten years after an episode of trade liberalization. Overall, trade liberalization led to larger and longer-lived declines in tax revenues in developing countries since 1970 than in today's rich countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Results are similar when we consider government expenditures, suggesting decreases in trade tax revenues negatively affect governments' capacity to provide public services in many developing countries.},

Using a large sample of Indian districts from the 1983\textendash 1999 period, we find that urbanization has a substantial and systematic poverty-reducing effect in the surrounding rural areas. The results obtained through an instrumental variable estimation suggest that this effect is causal in nature and is largely attributable to the positive spillovers of urbanization on the rural economy rather than to the movement of the rural poor to urban areas. This rural poverty-reduc- ing effect of urbanization is primarily explained by increased demand for local agricul- tural products and, to a lesser extent, by urban-rural remittances, the rural land/ population ratio, and rural nonfarm employment.},

  abstract = {In the regression-discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a ``large'' bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed.We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature. All results are readily available in R and STATA using our companion software packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, 2014b).},

To date, little research explores non-state social welfare, particularly in the Global South, and existing studies tend to focus on technical and administrative concerns while neglecting the potential political ramifications. This introductory essay aims to conceptualize and theorize the politics of non-state social welfare.We highlight three dimensions of the political consequences of non-state social welfare, including the implications for state capacity, equity of access to social welfare, and experiences of citizenship. Based on this framework as well as the findings of the empirical contributions to the special issue, the essay concludes that non-state provision may pose more political challenges than proponents recognize, but its effects are ultimately contingent on the types of relationships between state and non-state providers.},

When private firms, religious groups, or NGOs provide social goods, governments may be robbed of opportunities to generate public trust. Alternatively, satisfied consumers of private services may come to trust the state more. Using individual-level data from the 2008European Social Survey and country-level health care financing data we analyze the effects of private financing of health care on political trust in 25 European countries. Net of known predictors of trust at the individual and country level, we find that trust in government is significantly lower among at-risk individuals living in countries where the health system is financed to a greater degree by private sources. This negative relationship between private financing and trust in government is the outcome of a multi-step process in which low- income individuals report greater perceived risk of having unmet health care needs and, in turn, express less satisfaction with the heath care system, particularly in more privatized systems.},

  abstract = {Across the world, welfare states are under challenge (or were never developed extensively in the first place) while non-state actors increasingly provide public goods and basic welfare. In many parts of the Middle East and South Asia, sectarian organizations and political parties supply basic services to ordinary people more extensively and effectively than governments. In sub-Saharan Africa, families struggle to pay hospital fees, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) launch welfare programs as states cut subsidies and social programs. Likewise, in parts of Latin America, international and domestic NGOs and, increasingly, private firms are key suppliers of social welfare in both urban and rural communities. Even in the United States, where the welfare state is far more developed, secular NGOs and faith-based organizations are critical components of social safety nets. Despite official entitlements to public welfare, citizens in Russia face increasing out-of-pocket expenses as they are effectively compelled to seek social services through the private market. In The Politics of Non-state Social Welfare, a multidisciplinary group of contributors use survey data analysis, spatial analysis, in-depth interviews, and ethnographic and archival research to explore the fundamental transformation of the relationship between states and citizens. The book highlights the political consequences of the non-state provision of social welfare, including the ramifications for equitable and sustainable access to social services, accountability for citizens, and state capacity. The authors do not assume that non-state providers will surpass the performance of weak, inefficient, or sometimes corrupt states but instead offer a systematic analysis of a wide spectrum of non-state actors in a variety of contexts around the world, including sectarian political parties, faith-based organizations, community-based organizations, family networks, informal brokers, and private firms.

  abstract = {In Lebanon, religious parties such as Hezbollah play a critical role in providing health care, food, poverty relief, and other social welfare services alongside or in the absence of government efforts. Some parties distribute goods and services broadly, even to members of other parties or other faiths, while others allocate services more narrowly to their own base. In Compassionate Communalism, Melani Cammett analyzes the political logics of sectarianism through the lens of social welfare. On the basis of years of research into the varying welfare distribution strategies of Christian, Shia Muslim, and Sunni Muslim political parties in Lebanon, Cammett shows how and why sectarian groups deploy welfare benefits for such varied goals as attracting marginal voters, solidifying intraconfessional support, mobilizing mass support, and supporting militia fighters. Cammett then extends her arguments with novel evidence from the Sadrist movement in post-Saddam Iraq and the Bharatiya Janata Party in contemporary India, other places where religious and ethnic organizations provide welfare as part of their efforts to build political support. Nonstate welfare performs a critical function in the absence of capable state institutions, Cammett finds, but it comes at a price: creating or deepening social divisions, sustaining rival visions of the polity, or introducing new levels of social inequality. Compassionate Communalism is informed by Cammett's use of many methods of data collection and analysis, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of the location of hospitals and of religious communities; a large national survey of Lebanese citizens regarding access to social welfare; standardized open-ended interviews with representatives from political parties, religious charities, NGOs, and government ministries, as well as local academics and journalists; large-scale proxy interviewing of welfare beneficiaries conducted by trained Lebanese graduate students matched with coreligionist respondents; archival research; and field visits to schools, hospitals, clinics, and other social assistance programs as well as political party offices throughout the country.},

Our evidence points to the role of imperfect information. The introduction of IRS may have made the problem of malaria more salient, leading to a change in beliefs about its importance and to an increase in private health investments.},

  abstract = {The private school market has grown enormously in several developing coun- tries, but there is still little understanding of how poor parents choose schools for their children. This paper studies the demand for school attributes in Pak- istan, by estimating a standard model of demand for differentiated products to a dataset with information on school characteristics, school costs, household and child characteristics, and school choices. Parents have strong preferences for school attributes such as school facilities, the gender of the teacher, and most importantly, distance to one's residence. A 500 meter reduction in dis- tance to school is worth two thirds of the average annual school fee for girls, and the total annual school fee for boys (about USD\$13). Parents do not appear to value the average test scores of either the students or the teachers in the school, perhaps because they are hard to observe. Our estimates imply that, on average, girls benefited more than boys from the increased trend in private schools.},

This short paper considers an important\textemdash and previously overlooked\textemdash factor limiting the political engagement of many women in the developing world: marriage age. Drawing on nationally representative data from India and instrumenting marriage age with menarche age, we find delaying marriage has substantial positive effects on women's everyday political participation. A standard deviation increase in marriage age makes a woman 25 percent more likely to attend local council meetings, and 8 percent more likely to discuss politics with her husband. Exploring mechanisms, we show that education and time\textemdash rather than employment, mobility, and household decision-making power\textemdash appear to be the main channels. These findings underscore the critical role of early marriage in impeding women's participation in the political sphere.},

  abstract = {The aging of the global population, combined with changes in technology and cultural understandings of disease and the body, have thrust discussion and contestation over health into the center of local, national, and global politics. Is the politics of health different from the politics of other policy domains? On a number of dimensions, I conclude that it is. Voters and politicians in the developed world appear more likely to accept redistributive claims with respect to health than they are in other policy areas. Nations vary less widely in spending on health than on other functions of government and policy. Moral claims made about health are more likely to attach to its politics than are moral claims about the environment, labor, finance, and energy. More than these other realms, health politics encompasses issues regarding identity, the human body, and other personal matters that endow the health arena with greater significance. Bureaucratic agencies of state are more involved in the provision and regulation of health politics than in other areas, and the science-related nature of state expertise allows medical science itself to be sculpted in deeply political and administrative ways. The article concludes with reasons why political scientists should approach cross- policy generalizations cautiously, and with a call for greater engagement with health politics\textemdash to do for political science what health economics, the history of medicine, and medical sociology have done for other social science disciplines. 287},

  abstract = {Neighborhood Associations have assumed an important role in public policy decision making as the principal voice of the middle class across urban India. In recent years, these associations have sought a more formal role in policy making by contesting for political office in local elections in at least five major cities. This is significant not only because of its ``newness'' and implications on public policy but also because it represents a blurring of boundaries between the civil society, traditionally characterized by its `apolitical' nature, and the political society which has largely been the domain of the poor. Using the case of Delhi and drawing on examples from other metropolitan cities, this paper attempts to understand the factors that have led to the rise of middle class neighborhood associations and their subsequent advent into formal politics. The unique institutional environment of the capital and a Government of Delhi program that institutionalized citizen participation through these very associations makes Delhi a particularly interesting case. I discover that neighborhood associations with pre-existing networks with government agencies were more likely to remain apolitical, while the ones without these networks seek to become part of the government machinery through formal electoral channels. Policies on decentralization instituted by the Central and the State Government have been instrumental in this change. 4},

  abstract = {Comparative studies of social development are generally developed and tested by comparing territories. In this process, different forms of public goods provision are often combined to understand why a particular state or country fares better than others. But is something lost by assuming that the politics driving the various forms of social development fit the same rubric within a given territory? In this paper, we explore the variation in government support for two of the most recognized components of social development: education and healthcare. Using a novel dataset of Indian state-level public expenditure from 1958 to 2008, we find that sector classifications capture a considerable amount of the variation in overall patterns of public spending. While public spending for education and healthcare remain low for much of India's history, public spending for education shows a marked increase since the early 1990s, while healthcare continues to grow at a slow pace. A close examination of education and healthcare policy in the last six decades suggests that the prioritization of mass education may be explained by its perceived association to economic growth while the connection between healthcare and growth is still at a nascent stage in policy discourse. Our research strongly suggests that scholars need to go beyond the cross-territorial model if we are to truly understand the larger processes that guide social development.},

But what does this partnering of the state by civil society in crucial areas of collective life imply for the autonomy of the latter? And does the involvement of civil society mean that the state, instead of strengthening its own institutions for the delivery of basic services, has actually liberated itself from obligation to its citizens? A contrary view, however, emerges from a survey undertaken in a few residential areas of Delhi. Responses across the board indicated that citizens had high expectations from the state in spite of the fact that the state has begun to delegate more and more of its responsibilities to civil society organisations. As this article argues, such political preferences are the outcome of historical processes and how the development state came into being in post-independent India.},

Using two waves of the Indian Human Development Survey conducted in 2005 and 2011, we track the progress of primary schools in terms of infrastructure upgrade, teachers' quality, the costs of education, enrolment and learning outcomes. We find that while progress has been made in terms of infrastructure provision and enrolment, other aspects have either seen no progress or have worsened over time, and numerical and reading skills of children 8\textendash 11 years old worsening over time. Better performing states are generally in the South and in the extreme North. However, in terms of learning outcomes, the abysmal results are nationwide.},

This paper considers the offsetting effects to RTE from induced expansion of private tutoring in the educationally competitive districts of India. We develop a unique database of registrations of new private educational institutions offering tutorial services by local district between 2001-2015. We estimate the causal impact of RTE on private supplemental education by comparing the growth of these private tutorial institutions in districts identified a priori as having very competitive educational markets to those that had less competitive educational markets. We find a strong impact of RTE on the private tutoring market and show that this holds across alternative definitions of highly competitive districts and a variety of robustness checks, sensitivity analyses, and controls. Finally, we provide descriptive evidence that these private tutoring schools do increase the achievement (and competitiveness) of students able to afford them.}

A concise history of India's postcolonial development is provided with an explanation of the specific challenges that were faced by the nation-state. The internet provides some definite benefits. A virtual Indian community can be imagined in cyberspace that also contains a discursive Indian domain. This assists the survival of India's national culture on a global level. However, the internet provides no support towards the maintenance of a state structure in a transnational world, and is also beneficial to counternational movements. These indicate the inevitability of a post-national existence. The paper concludes that devising a system of electronic citizenship might be the only solution for the continuation of the Indian nation-state. Nation-states},

  abstract = {Can the access to political power by a few members of a socially disadvantaged group trickle down to city streets and change common beliefs related to members of that group? Can it, in turn, alter the nature of day-to-day interpersonal relations between members of the different groups? To answer these questions, this dissertation focuses on recent efforts to include members of the scheduled castes (the ex-``untouchables'') through the use of "reservation" for key executive positions in India's village institutions. These radical quotas, in place since the mid-1990's, abruptly allowed members of the scheduled castes to be elected as heads of village councils, in a bold move disregarding the on-going social practice of untouchability. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Northern Indian state of Rajasthan, I suggest that this political inclusion may affect a wide range of beliefs related to members of the scheduled castes (beliefs about their qualities, their place in society, social norms in interacting with them, or the consequence of hostile behavior towards them, etc\textbackslash ldots). To test these intuitions, the dissertation combines a ``natural experiment'' with two Large-N audio surveys ran across 64 villages, and compares the untouchability-related attitudes of villagers who have experienced political power by a member of the scheduled castes to the attitudes of villagers who have not experienced it. Results suggest that the experience of a member of the scheduled castes in office significantly increased inter- castes contact and affected a number of beliefs among members of all groups. In particular, members of the scheduled castes that experienced a co-ethnic in office reported perceiving less discrimination, while members of dominant groups developed new norms of tolerance and were more likely to believe that hostile behaviors would not go unpunished. More importantly, as indicated by further analyses, this experience may have developed more assertive behaviors among members of the scheduled castes, and reduced hostile and segregating behaviors among dominant castes. Altogether, these findings suggest that the experience of political leadership by a member from a disadvantaged group can significantly improve the daily wellbeing of other individuals from those groups.},

The findings, however, differ by gender: the IV estimates on spending are statistically significant only for male literacy. India's historical experience thus suggests that building more schools would not have solved the problem of female illiteracy that continues to persist even today.},

Using an analytical framework relying on political settlement and ideas, it engages in process-tracing of the critical policy choices of the CBHI development. The study finds that the commitment to expanding health insurance coverage was made possible by a dominant political settlement. CBHI is part of the broader efforts of the regime to foster its legitimacy based on rapid socio-economic development. Yet, CBHI was chosen over other potential solutions to expand access to healthcare because it was also the option the most compatible with the ruling coalition core ideology.},

In recent years, public reporting of governmental performance has expanded in many policy domains, potentially enhancing citizen capacities to make accu- rate evaluations.

Using survey data, we find that citizens' perceptions of the quality of specific public schools reflect available information about the level of student achievement in those schools. The relationship between perceived and actual school quality is two to three times stronger for parents of school-age children, who have the most contact with schools and arguably the strongest incentive to be informed. A regression discontinuity analysis of an over- sample of Florida residents confirms that public accountability systems can have a causal effect on citizen perceptions of service quality, partic- ularly for those with fewer alternative sources of relevant information.},

We provide experimental evidence that information about copious corruption not only decreases incumbent support in local elections in Mexico, but also decreases voter turnout, challengers' votes, and erodes voters' identification with the party of the corrupt incumbent. Our results suggest that while flows of information are necessary, they may be insufficient to improve political accountability, since voters may respond to information by withdrawing from the political process. We conclude with a discussion of the institutional contexts that could allow increased access to information to promote government accountability.},

This argument derives from our belief that environmental context has pervasive consequences for the organization and operation of all schools and specifically that the key differences between public and private environments-and thus between public and private schools -derive from their characteristic methods of social control: the public schools are subordinates in a hierarchic system of democratic politics, whereas private schools are largely autonomous actors "controlled" by the market.},

  abstract = {The private school sector in India has grown significantly but the equity implications of this growth are not well understood. Traditionally private schools have been patronised by more educated and betteroff families. Evidence also suggests a preference for enrolling male children in private schools. With the growth in the private school sector it is unclear whether these conventional patterns of private enrolment are changing. The (uneven but ongoing) implementation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act will likely create further opportunities for private school access. If research finds that access to the private sector remains uneven across the society in spite of this growth, then it may offer a note of caution against relying on private provision, and it may also provide an indication of the potentially significant and continued importance of public provision of education. In this paper we use district-level data from 2005\textendash 2006 and 2011\textendash 2012 to estimate how private enrolment patterns have changed alongside an appreciable growth in number of private schools. While 2011\textendash 2012 is too soon to evaluate the impact of RTE (as most states were still drafting rules and regulations) we identify states that eventually adapted clearer RTE regulations to investigate if private school enrolment patterns were changing differently in these states. The data show that a large growth in the private sector has not made patterns of private school enrolment more equitable in rural areas. In urban districts the data indicate a declining caste gap in private enrolment and a decline in the private enrolment gap between poor and non-poor students in states which eventually went on to adopt clearer RTE regulations.},

  abstract = {As the private education sector grows across the globe, private providers by extension are becoming significant employers of teachers. In India, more than 3 million teachers are employed in the private sector, contributing to meeting the rapidly expanding educational demands and learning needs of children. Teacher working conditions are crucial to ensure teacher retention and success within the education system. We use the 2011\textendash 2012, na\- tionally representative employment data from India, to investigate private teacher working conditions. We conduct a series of regression analysis to account for the differences in demographic attributes of public and private teachers, differences in rural and urban growth of private schools and cross-state variations. We find that, compared to public school teachers, private school teachers experience less favorable monetary and nonmonetary working conditions including less access to paid leaves, pension and health care. They also experi\- ence lower job security in terms of the existence of a contract and the length of contract period. Private school teachers also have a lower access to teacher unions and thus weaker collective bargaining to negotiate their working conditions. Private teachers are more frequently likely to seek additional work and alternate work. Some noteworthy differences in teacher demographics in rural and urban areas (urban teachers are more likely to be female, somewhat older, and more educated) notwithstanding, these patterns of public-private teacher working conditions are consistent across rural and urban location. We conclude with reflections on potential explanations for these results and suggest steps for future research.},

In contrast, middle-class networks, bringing Islamists and non-Islamists together, are expanded and strengthened via ISIs. The case studies confirm that moderate Islamism is a movement of the marginalized, educated middle class, not of the disenfranchised poor.},

Using data that span 1998 to 2016 from North Carolina, one of the first states to come under this color-blind dictum, we examine the ways in which households and policymakers took actions that had the effect of reducing the amount of interracial contact in K12 schools within counties. We divide these reductions in interracial contact into portions due to the private school and charter school sectors, the existence of multiple school districts, and racial disparities between schools within districts and sectors. For most counties, the last of these proves to be the biggest, though in some counties private schools, charter schools, or multiple districts played a deciding role. In addition, we decompose segregation in the state's 13 metropolitan areas, finding that more than half can be attributed to racial disparities inside school districts. We also measure segregation by economic status, finding that it, like racial segregation, increased in the largest urban counties, but elsewhere changed little over the period.},

We find that the within-school component accounted for a sizable share of total segregation in middle schools and high schools. Recognizing its importance could temper the praise for school assignment policies that reduce racial disparities between schools but allow large disparities within them. More generally, we observe between the two components a complementary relationship, with one component tending to be large when the other one is small. Comparing the degree of segregation for the state's two largest racial/ethnic minority groups, we find that White/Hispanic segregation was more severe than White/Black segregation, particularly within schools. Analyzed as separate administrative units, schools with large shares of Black students tended to have more White/Black segregation across classrooms than schools with smaller shares. Finally, we examine enrollment patterns by course and show that school segregation brings with it differences by race and ethnicity in the courses that students take, with White students more likely to be enrolled in advanced classes.},

The urban poor, meanwhile, are perceived as organised predominantly through the sphere of politics. This paper, using survey and ethnographic data on neighbourhood associations in Chennai, argues that these accounts are over-schematised. There are considerable overlaps between civil and political society: the urban poor increasingly resort to civil associational forms to claim urban citizenship, and middle class associations are more deeply engaged with the sphere of formal politics than their own or scholarly accounts convey.},

There is significant cross-sectional targeting, with large increases in districts in which the election is particularly close.

This article proposes that, if part of ethnicity's utility is informational, we should expect that voters' reliance on ethnic cues will decline when certain types of higher-quality information are available. To test this, a survey experiment was conducted in Uganda, with subjects evaluating candidates under varying informational environments. While support for co-ethnics was high when ethnicity was the only distinguishing fact about candidates, it declined when information was presented that portrayed co-ethnics negatively vis-a`-vis non co-ethnics. These results suggest that informational environments can impact ethnic voting.},

The analysis indicates that the enrollment of district students in charter schools reduced the number of votes cast in district school board contests and, correspondingly, reduced turnout in the odd-year elections in which those contests are held. This impact is concentrated in districts that serve low-achieving, impover- ished, and minority students, leading to a modest decline in the share of voters in those districts who are black and who have children. There is little evidence that charter school expansion affected the outcomes of school board elections or turnout in other elections.},

This paper analyzes the spillover effects of charter schools on traditional public school (TPS) students in New York City. I exploit variation in both the timing of charter school entry and distance to the nearest charter school to obtain credibly causal estimates of the impacts of charter schools on TPS student performance, and I am among the first to estimate the impacts of charter school co-location. I further add to the literature by exploring potential mechanisms for these findings with school-level data on per pupil expenditures (PPE), and parent and teacher perceptions of schools. Briefly, I find charter schools significantly increase TPS student performance in both English Language Arts and math, and decrease the probability of grade retention. Effects increase with charter school proximity and are largest in TPSs co-located with charter schools. Potential explanations for improved performance include increased PPE, academic expectations, student engagement, and a more respectful and safe school environment after charter entry. The findings suggest that more charter schools in New York City may be beneficial at the margin, and co-location may be mutually beneficial for charter and traditional public schools.},

However, in electoral authoritarian regimes, educated voters may instead deliberately disengage. If education increases critical capacities, political awareness, and support for democracy, educated citizens may believe that participation is futile or legitimates autocrats. We test this argument in Zimbabwe\textemdash a paradigmatic electoral authoritarian regime\textemdash by exploiting cross- cohort variation in access to education following a major educational reform. We find that education decreases political participation, substantially reducing the likelihood that better-educated citizens vote, contact politicians, or attend community meetings. Consistent with deliberate disengagement, education's negative effect on participation dissipated following 2008's more competitive election, which (temporarily) initiated unprecedented power sharing. Supporting the mechanisms underpinning our hypoth- esis, educated citizens experience better economic outcomes, are more interested in politics and more supportive of democracy, but are also more likely to criticize the government and support opposition parties.},

Our analyses show that Swedes living in countries with low levels of institutional quality display significantly lower levels of political trust and support compared to the native population, demonstrating that experience of institutional quality is more important than socialization and culture. However, long-time exposure to, and socialization into, a new cultural and institutional setting triggers something like a process of resocialization, in which the difference in satisfaction and trust decreases over time.

On average across all four elections, I estimate that parents become 2.8 percentage points more likely to vote. In a context where the average turnout rate for parents is around 75\%, this is a considerable effect. The effect is driven by parents whose children still live with them while there is no discernible effect for parents whose child has left home.

The study exploits the fact that two-voter households moving in together right before an election are comparable to those moving in together right after the election. Depending on the model specification, turnout increases by 3.5 to 10.6 percentage points in the months after taking up cohabitation. Voters are mobilized regardless of their own and their cohabitant's turnout behavior in a previous election.

In the public sector, education subsidies and salary payments translate into little (and in small clinics, very little) effort and care.

Correct diagnoses were rare, incorrect treatments were widely prescribed, and adherence to clinical checklists was higher in private than in public clinics.

We report three main findings. First, private providers are mostly unqualified but spent more time with patients, and completed more items on a checklist of essential history and examination items than public providers, while being no different in their diagnostic and treatment accuracy. Second, we identify the private practices of qualified public sector doctors, and show that the same doctors exert higher effort and are more likely to provide correct treatment in their private practices. Third, we find a strong positive correlation between provider effort and prices charged in the private sector, whereas we find no correlation between effort and wages in the public sector. Our results suggest that market-based accountability in the unregulated private sector may be providing better incentives for provider effort than administrative accountability in the public sector in this setting. While the overall quality of care is low in both the public and private sectors, these differences in provider effort may partly explain the dominant market share of fee-charging private providers even in the presence of a system of free public healthcare.},

As a `reassemblage', participation is employed to reconfigure democracy and development along different political axes.

A more detailed analysis also shows that the rural India benefits the most from the intense political competition as compared to urban India. We also found that if the same government rules a state for a relatively longer period, it helps the state in achieving higher HDI score. Increasing voter participation found to be positively associated with HDI score, but this finding is confined to the sample of major Indian states only. Increasing public spending on developmental activities is also found to have a positive and significant effect on HDI performance.

It is possible that when one challenges some phenomenon, one begins to `see' it more. Alternatively, activism might focus awareness on only certain manifestations of the problem of interest. The type of activism should matter here. We anticipate that only forms of resistance that increase exposure to oppression/oppressors and/or other challengers are likely to increase the number of discriminatory actions identified. Especially important here is nonviolent direct action because of the significant amount of training and interaction among activists that is facilitated by such activities as well as the exten- sive amount of exposure that nonviolence generally subjects participants to. Utilizing a unique database of 98,316 untouchables (or Dalits) from 1,589 rural villages in Gujarat, India, we find support for our argument. Specifically, Dalits who engaged in nonviolent action which increased either exposure to oppression/oppressors or exposure to other activists but not both, identified a higher number of discriminatory events. In short, some activism does acti- vate some awareness. This has implications for dissident commitment, radicalization, and post-conflict political processes.},

There is skepticism about the ability of econometric analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing use in development economics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate quasi- randomization through instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful for policy or understanding: two key issues are the misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that experiments have no special ability to produce more credible knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject to practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate using prominent experiments in development and elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based evaluation of projects, without guidance from an understanding of underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to scientific progress in the understanding of economic development. I welcome recent trends in development experimentation away from the evaluation of projects and toward the evaluation of theoretical mechanisms. (JEL C21, F35, O19)},

On the basis of two rounds of surveys of 2,517 households, we use a strategy of double differences and propensity score matching to assess the economic effects of a program that promoted and strength- ened self-help groups in Andhra Pradesh in India. Our analysis finds that longer expo- sure to the program has a positive impact on consumption, nutritional intake, and asset accumulation. Our investigation into the heterogeneity of these effects suggests that even the poorest households are able to benefit from the program.},

The evidence comes from the randomized component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the incumbent's vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment also reveals that opposition parties' vote shares were unaffected by the program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by CCTsmay be best explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These findings are difficult to reconcilewith the notion that the electoral effects of CCTs are a result of prospective concerns triggered by threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment. Instead, the evidence in this article suggests that CCTs' mobilizing effects are compatible with programmatic politics.},

Combining regional disparities of access to school with the timing of the program, I adopt a difference-in-difference approach. To estimate the returns to education for the entire population and not only for wage workers, I use a two-sample estimation approach to predict consumption for every household and find that education increases predicted consumption for household heads working in every sector. I also provide evidence that education increases the probability of working in agriculture for women. These results, at first surprising, suggest that education may influence the structural transformation and that returns to education are positive in agriculture, provided that skills taught at school are consistent with agriculture.},

We focus on the distinct influences of convergence and agglomeration on growth in the number of start-up firms as well as in employment in these new firms in a given region-industry. While reversion to the mean and diminishing returns to entrepreneurship at the region-industry level can result in a convergence effect, the presence of complementary economic activity creates externalities that enhance incentives and reduce barriers for new business creation. Clusters are a particularly important way through which location-based complementarities are realized. The empirical analysis uses a novel panel dataset from the Longitudinal Business Database of the Census Bureau and the US Cluster Mapping Project. Using this dataset, there is significant evidence of the positive impact of clusters on entrepreneurship. After controlling for convergence in start-up activity at the region- industry level, industries located in regions with strong clusters (i.e. a large presence of other related industries) experience higher growth in new business formation and start-up employment. Strong clusters are also associated with the formation of new establish- ments of existing firms, thus influencing the location decision of multi-establishment firms. Finally, strong clusters contribute to start-up firm survival.},

A growing body of empirical literature has shown the positive impact of clusters on regional and industry performance, including job creation, patenting, and new business formation. There is an increasing need for cluster-based data to support research, facilitate comparisons of clusters across regions, and support policymakers and practitioners in defining regional strategies. This paper develops a novel clustering algorithm that systematically generates and assesses sets of cluster definitions (i.e., groups of closely related industries). We implement the algorithm using 2009 data for U.S. industries (6-digit NAICS), and propose a new set of benchmark cluster definitions that incorporates measures of inter-industry linkages based on co-location patterns, input-output links, and similarities in labor occupations. We also illustrate the algorithm's ability to compare alternative sets of cluster definitions by evaluating our new set against existing sets in the literature. We find that our proposed set outperforms other methods in capturing a wide range of inter-industry linkages, including grouping industries within the same 3-digit NAICS.},

Using data from the recently collected India Human Development Survey, this paper seeks to provide a description of private schooling in India and examine the effects of private school enrollment on educational quality. The results suggest that controlling for the endogeneity of school choice, children in private schools have higher reading and arithmetic skills than those in government schools. While overall gains are modest in size, about one fourth to one third of a standard deviation, the gains for students from lower economic strata are higher than those for upper income students. The paper explores this relationship by examining the treatment of students from different economic strata in government and private schools and finds that while students from lower economic strata are more likely to be physically punished in government schools than their better off peers, the relationship between parental economic status and physical punishment is negligible in private schools. 1},

Two years of exposure to these programs increased women's participation in group savings programs as well as the non-agricultural labor force. Compared to women in control villages, treated women were also more likely to participate in household decisions and engage in civic activities. We find no evidence however, that participation increased income or had a disproportionate impact by women's socio- economic status.

It further develops the analytical framework of the World Development Report 2004 on accountability relationships, to emphasize the underlying political economy drivers of accountability and implications for how civil society is constituted and functions. It argues on this basis that the most important domain for improving accountability is through the political relations between citizens, civil society, and state leadership. Te evidence broadly suggests that when higher-level political leadership provides sufficient or appropriate powers for citizen participation in holding within-state agencies or frontline providers accountable, there is frequently positive impact on outcomes. However, the big question remaining for such types of interventions is how to improve the incentives of higher-level leadership to pursue appropriate policy design and implementation. Te paper argues that there is substantial scope for greater efforts in this domain, including through the support of external aid agencies. Such efforts and support should, however, build on existing political and civil society structures (rather than transplanting ``best practice'' initiatives from elsewhere), and be structured for careful monitoring and assessment of impact.},

Lucky squatters who end up with legal titles report beliefs closer to those that favor the workings of a free market.

The effects appear large. The value of a (generated) index of ``market'' beliefs is 20 percent higher for titled squatters than for untitled squatters, in spite of leading otherwise similar lives. Moreover, the effect is sufficiently large so as to make the beliefs of the squatters with legal titles broadly comparable to those of the general Buenos Aires population, in spite of the large differences in the lives they lead.},

The effect, while statistically significant, seems small adding only 0.8 points on a 1\textendash 10 scale. Moreover, the effect of priming subjects with government propaganda against privatization has an effect that almost offsets the effect of gaining water.

The model is general enough to yield two often-discussed but competing theories as special cases.

If groups have party affinities, and each party is more effective in delivering favors to its own support group, then we can get the "machine pol- itics" outcome, where each party favors its core support group. We derive these results theoretically, and illustrate their operation in particular examples.}

It also finds a synergistic matching between a democratic ruler and an altruistic bureaucrat who internalizes the citizens' welfare. This synergy is absent for autocrats, but they can gain by extorting from highly altruistic agencies like NGOs.},

A great and unusual combination which I admire enormously.'- Dame Sally Morgan, Adviser to the Board, Absolute Return for Kids and former chief advisor to Tony Blair, UK'This fine book has a powerful message for policymakers and donors: the quality of schools matters even in poor countries; hence, the poor are abandoning failed state schools and enrolling their kids in low cost private schools. Instead of trying to close them down, the state and donors would do well to invest in children (through vouchers and cash transfers) and give parents a choice rather than create more atrocious, monopolistic state schools where teachers are absent and unaccountable.'- Gurcharan Das, commentator and author, India Unbound and former CEO of Proctor and Gamble, Asia'This is a must-read book for anyone interested in the plight of poor children, particularly for those readers concerned with learning about culturally sensitive and proven ways to reach out and help less fortunate children in developing countries. I was fascinated and outraged by the compelling stories and actual data that Dixon shares in this gem of an expos\'e. Most readers will similarly be shaken and incensed by the failure of billions of dollars spent on state schooling in Africa and India. Dixon makes a compelling case for the value and contributions of low cost private schools in slums and low income areas in developing countries. After reading this book, I am now a believer!'- Steven I. Pfeiffer, Professor, Florida State University, USThis fascinating volume challenges the widely held belief that the state should supply, finance and regulate schooling in developing countries. Using India as an example, Dr. Pauline Dixon examines the ways in which private, for-profit schools might serve as a successful alternative to state-run systems of education in impoverished communities around the world.The book begins with a thorough history of India's government-run schools - based on the traditional British model - which are currently characterized by high levels of waste, inefficiency and subpar student performance. The author goes on to present comprehensive survey and census data, along with analyses of different school management types and their effect on student achievement, teacher attendance and quality of facilities. The book also tackles the problem of inefficient allocation and use of international aid, and offers recommendations on the development of new mechanisms for utilizing aid resources in support of low-cost private schools.This meticulously researched volume will appeal to students and professors of development studies, political economy and international studies. Policymakers and other officials with an interest in educational innovation will also find much of interest in this book.Contents: Preface - A Vignette from Hyderabad Introduction - Never Assume 1.

But the accredited social health activists, an important component of JSY, play a limited role in facilitating delivery in a medical facility. Importantly, even though the proportion of women delivering in a medical facility has improved considerably, a significant fraction of women continues to deliver at home.

The main challenge in estimating such an effect is that the decision to send the child for private tutoring is correlated with unobserved variables which are also correlated with learning outcomes. This paper utilizes a large household survey conducted in rural India, and employs Fixed Effect (FE) estimation to control for the effect of unobserved variables. We find positive and significant effect of private tutoring on learning outcomes for students at elementary level (grades 1-8). This effect is equivalent to an additional year of schooling or being in a private school instead of a government school. The effect is stronger for the students enrolled in government schools compared to the students enrolled in private schools, for children from economically disadvantaged background, and for children whose parents are relatively less educated. These are, to our knowledge, the first estimates of impact of private tutoring on learning outcomes in the Indian context.},

This paper tests whether a simple incentive program based on teacher presence can reduce teacher absence, and whether it has the potential to lead to more teaching activities and better learning. In 60 informal one-teacher schools in rural India, randomly chosen out of 120 (the treatment schools), a financial incentive program was initiated to reduce absenteeism. Teachers were given a camera with a tamper- proof date and time function, along with instructions to have one of the children photograph the teacher and other students at the beginning and end of the school day. The time and date stamps on the photographs were used to track teacher attendance. A teacher's salary was a direct function of his attendance. The remaining 60 schools served as comparison schools. The introduction of the program resulted in an immediate decline in teacher absence. The absence rate (measured using unannounced visits both in treatment and comparison schools) changed from an average of 42 percent in the comparison schools to 22 percent in the treatment schools. When the schools were open, teachers were as likely to be teaching in both types of schools, and the number of students present was roughly the same. The program positively affected child achievement levels: a year after the start of the program, test scores in program schools were 0.17 standard deviations higher than in the comparison schools and children were 40 percent more likely to be admitted into regular schools.

Previous research has suggested weak effects of mandated representation on the targeting of material benefits to marginalized castes and tribes in India. Yet, such effects could be conditional on the nature of partisan mobilization or on the degree to which party ties cross-cut caste groupings; or, they may be influenced by the shadow of dynamic rotation of quotas across local village councils. To evaluate these possibilities, I assess the distributive impact of quotas in two Indian states: Uttar Pradesh, where partisan mobilization has created a tighter link between caste and party ties than in other Indian states; and Jharkhand, where village council elections were held for the first time in 2010 and where dynamic considerations may play a limited role. I find that while quotas shape perceptions of council priorities, quotas also have quite weak distributive effects in these two states. Moreover, survey experiments suggest that voters' partisan ties to candidates have at least as strong an independent effect on their expectations of benefit receipt as do their caste ties. These results suggest that formal rules can have quite uniform impacts across diverse contexts, though the evidence is consistent with different interpretations about the global impact of institutional changes.},

As part of the newly defined minimum facilities in primary schools, Operation Blackboard supplied a second teacher to many existing single teacher, single room establishments. Through this programme, policy-makers intended to upgrade the quality of school education and effect a major revision of teaching methods. But, although the policy acknowledged teachers' centrality to educational change, the innovation arising from it failed to prepare teachers to adapt to its demands. Centrally conceived, it allowed neither State-level administrators nor teachers any sense of ownership or participation in decision-making. No allowance for teachers' generally low professional competence, training and motivation was made; and nor was it recognised that differences in socio-economic contexts would affect teachers' capacity to utilise what was provided. The implications of findings made in three very different socio-economic locations within a single District of Gujarat State can be generalised to the State level, and are significant also at a national level for policy-makers seeking to initiate educational innovations in the current circumstances.},

Taking a sample of six district institutes of education and training (DIETs) across three states as a case study, this paper explores India's policy and processes of decentralising teacher education. It identifies as major barriers to the emergence of DIETs their recruitment and staffing policies, and contested agendas of power, control and accountability. Yet it also finds evidence from two districts of progress towards establishing productive partnerships, in an emerging process of decentralisation that is allowing the DIETs to play a significant role in supporting teachers. Here, the DIET idea is justified, and the potential of a decentralised teacher education system to improve systemic accountability towards quality improvement and primary teachers is demonstrated.},

As a result, autocracies that rely heavily on the broad-based distribution of spoils for their survival, namely party-based regime, should be especially vulnerable to in- creases in remittances. Using data from 137 autocracies in 91 countries from 1975-2009, we show that remittances increase the likelihood of democratization in party-based regimes. We also show that remittances are associated with a decline in electoral support for incumbents in party-based autocracies.}

  abstract = {Lipsky's classic study of `street-level bureaucracy' (1980) provided a perceptive analysis of front line practice in public organizations that has continuing relevance to recent literature, which has debated whether discretion continues to operate in social work or whether it has been curtailed. Having considered contributions to the debate on the continuation and curtailment of professional discretion in social work, it becomes clear that there are significant differences between these two positions, differences which focus on beliefs about managers' desire for, and ability to secure, control and workers' ability to resist control and seek discretion. However, after examining these issues further, through an examination of key aspects of Lipsky's work and Howe's (1991) critique of that work, a unifying strand is identified in the curtailment and continuation perspectives. Both perspectives have a tendency to treat professional discretion as a phenomenon that is either present or absent and rest on a background assumption, particularly in the curtailment literature, that professional discretion is self-evidently a `good thing'. An alternative argument is advanced, based on two propositions: first, that the proliferation of rules and regulations should not automatically be equated with greater control over professional discretion; paradoxically, more rules may create more discretion. Second, discretion in itself is neither `good' nor `bad'. In some circumstances it may be an important professional attribute, in others it may be a cloak for political decision-makers to hide behind or it may be an opportunity for professional abuse of power. If this alternative argument is soundly professionals have at specific conjunctures should be evaluated on a situation-by- situation basis. based, future analysis of and research into professional discretion rooted in `all-or-nothing' formulations are unlikely to advance understanding much beyond the impasse in the existing literature. Rather, the alternative argument suggests that discretion should be regarded as a series of gradations of freedom to make decisions and, therefore, the degree of freedom},

In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, protests and strikes suggest that pay is low, while comparisons to average national income per capita suggest that it is high. This study presents data on teacher earnings from 15 African countries. The results suggest that in several (seven) countries, teachers' monthly earnings are lower than other formal sector workers with comparable levels of education and experience. However, in all of those countries, teachers report working significantly fewer hours than other workers, such that hourly earnings are significantly lower for teachers in only one country. The study documents nonpecuniary benefits (such as medical insurance or a pension) for teachers relative to other workers: of the 13 country surveys that report non-pecuniary benefits, teachers are more likely to receive at least one benefit than other workers in 11. Teachers who report fewer hours are no more likely to report holding a second job, although teachers overall are nearly two times more likely to hold a second job than other workers. The study documents other characteristics of the teacher labor force across countries\textemdash e.g., mostly male but less so than other workers, mostly employed by the public sector. The study also documents within-country variation across types of teacher contracts\textemdash e.g., teachers on fixed term contracts make about 70 percent of teachers on permanent contracts, with wide variation across countries. The large heterogeneity in teacher earnings premia is not easily explained by observed characteristics of the countries' economies or education systems. Nonetheless, after taking hours and non-pecuniary benefits into account, we find no evidence that teachers are systematically underpaid in this sample of countries.},

The effects are identified using staggered timing of state elections. We find that rulers allocate more primary school resources in the years preceding and following elections, but there is only weak evidence that resources are targeted to marginal constituencies. The resources affected are visible ones, namely free school uniforms, classrooms, toilets, ramps for the disabled and medical inspections. We also show that around election years, teachers spend more time on ``non-teaching'' activities. The political cycles are not inevitable, as they are present only in districts characterised by low voter turnout and low female literacy. Finally, we show that electoral cycles affect human capital accumulation: The phase of the electoral cycle in which pupils begin their primary schooling, affects their learning outcomes.},

From this it derives a model of local government responsiveness as the product of political openness and substantive competition. The quality of local politics, in turn, emerges endogenously as the joint product of the lobbying and political engagement of local firms and interests and the organizational density and ability of civil society. The analysis tests the theory's predictions on a database containing all Bolivian municipalities. The theory proves robust. The combined methodology provides a higher-order empirical rigor than either approach can alone.},

In turn, it defines context as the relevant aspects of a setting in which an array of initial conditions leads to an outcome of a defined scope and meaning via causal mechanisms. Drawing from these definitions is the argument that credible causal explanation can occur if and only if researchers are attentive to the interaction between causal mechanisms and context, regardless of whether the methods employed are small-sample, formal, statistical, or interpretive.},

Where dozens of ``microinsurance'' and NGO pilots failed to scale up, RSBY has already provided more than 110 million people (almost 10 percent of India's population) with heavily subsidized health insurance, providing up to US\$550 annually to finance secondary hospital care. Although the research evidence on RSBY is still developing, early results are encouraging: increased utilization and hospitalization; some indication of reduced out-of-pocket payments for healthcare; and a means of identification with a clearly linked entitlement. While RSBY still faces challenges, particularly on the quality of care of increased hospitalization rates, RSBY has aligned incentives for both public and private hospitals to deliver better care. In this essay, Victoria Fan tells the story of how RSBY came into being under the leadership of Anil Swarup\textemdash whom she describes as an ``unassuming officer of the Indian Administrative Service''\textemdash and outlines the program's early successes and opportunities for future progress.},

There is also strong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games.

This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence.We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selfish types dominate equilibrium behavior.},

In the second part, we develop a concept of transnational governmentality as a way of grasping how new practices of government and new forms of "grassroots" politics may call into question the principles of vertical ity and encompass- ment that have long helped to legitimate and naturalize states' authority over "the local."},

  abstract = {A state monopoly in schooling followed the collapse of communism in Central Europe. The centrally planned system was abandoned. Systems comparable with educational voucher scheme, also known as school choice system, were introduced in the Czech Republic and Hungary in the early 1990s. The newly established system of school financing allocates public funds according to the number of students enrolled in a school. Accredited non-state schools, private and religious, are also eligible for public subsidies. The scope and the form of these reforms represent a unique opportunity to test conflicting hypotheses of proponents and opponents of the voucher scheme. In this empirical analysis, we test fundamental theoretical predictions of the voucher model. Specifically, we test: i) whether non-state schools are established at locations where the supply of educational opportunities provided by state schools is low or of low quality, ii) whether state and non-state schools in such a system respond to changes in demand for education, and iii) whether state schools respond to competition from non-state schools. We use detailed school level data on the whole population of schools and data on regional conditions. In our econometric model we estimate education value added, instead of relying on absolute quality of school graduates. We find that non-state school emerge at locations with excess demand and lower quality state schools. We also find that greater competition from non-state schools creates incentives for state schools with the result that state schools slightly improve the quality of educational inputs used and significantly improve their output, quality of graduates. As concerns the technical schools, we find that non-state schools react to regional labor market conditions in terms of technical branch premium and unemployment rate. We do not find such reactions to market signals by state schools. We introduce this analysis with a review of non-state schools' development in the Czech Republic and Hungary during the 1990s.},

This ar- ticle focuses on the evidence showing two weak links in the chain between government spending for services to improve health and actual improvements in health status. First, institutional capacity is a vital ingredient in providing effective services. When this capac- ity is inadequate, health spending, even on the right services, may lead to little actual provision of services. Second, the net effect of government health services depends on the severity of market failures\textemdash the more severe the market failures, the greater the potential for government services to have an impact. Evidence suggests that market failures are the least severe for relatively inexpensive curative services, which often absorb the bulk of primary health care budgets. A companion paper, available from the authors (seep. 219), offers a perspective on how government funds can best be used to improve health and well- being in developing countries. It gives an alternative view of appropriate public health policy, one that focuses on mitigating the characteristic market failures of the sector and tailoring public health activities to the government's ability to deliver various servic},

To validate the method and to show that the asset index predicts enrollments as accurately as expenditures, or more so, we use data sets from Indonesia, Paki- stan, and Nepal that contain information on both expenditures and assets. The results show large, variable wealth gaps in children's enrollment across Indian states. On average a ``rich'' child is 31 percentage points more likely to be enrolled than a ``poor'' child, but this gap varies from only 4.6 percentage points in Kerala to 38.2 in Uttar Pradesh and 42.6 in Bihar.},

The second was the ``crowding out'' of private markets for health care, markets that exist predominantly at the primary health care level. This article presents an approach to public policy in health that comes directly from the literature on public economics. It identifies two characteristic market failures in health. The first is the existence of large externalities in the control of many infectious diseases that are mostly addressed by standard public health interventions. The second is the widespread breakdown of insurance markets that leave people exposed to cata- strophic financial losses. Other essential considerations in setting priorities in health are the degree to which policies address poverty and inequality and the practicality of implementing policies given limited administrative capacities. Priorities based on these criteria tend to differ substantially from those commonly prescribed by the international community.},

We find that riot-exposed Hindu branch managers lend relatively less to Muslim borrowers, and these loans are less likely to default, consistent with riot exposure exacerbating taste-based discrimination.

Exploiting variation in the timing of laws across the states and using data on the political participation of public school teachers from 1956 to 2004, we find that the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law significantly boosted subsequent political participation among teachers.We also identify increased contact from organized groups seeking to mobilize teachers as a likely mechanism that explains this finding.

By revisiting revolutionary feminism in the 1970s, it contrasts two strategic perspectives articulated in debates about housework: what Selma James called the ``perspective of winning'' and what I call the ``perspective of investment,'' a strategy for change that sees short-term reforms as investments in~long-term transformations.~In light of this, I endorse the demand to socialize housework as apt for the contemporary care economy and show how my account of demand-making contributes to the political theory of social movements by clarifying movement demands for ``non-reformist reforms,'' such as defund the police.},

We begin with Hirschman's characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society.We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice. 14.1},

This paper proposes a test for manipulation of the running variable that is consistent when the running variable is discrete. The test ex- ploits the fact that if the discrete running variable|for example, age in quarters|is based on an underlying (but unobserved) variable|such as exact age|with a density that satis{$\dottedsquare$}es a certain smoothness condition, then the observed frequency at the threshold has a known conditional distribution. The proposed test is applied to vote tally distributions in union representation elections and reveals evidence of manipulation in close elections that is in favor of employers when Republicans control the NLRB and in favor of unions otherwise.},

The author illuminates the contradiction between the practice of accommodative politics and the commitment to social change that characterized India's development policies. Using data from interviews conducted over a 30-year period, Professor Frankel analyses the strategy of democratic social transformation adapted from Gandhi's two-pronged approach: class accommodation combined with an indirect attack on the social basis of exploitation. She examines the failures in implementation of basic social reform that led India during the post-Nehru period into an economic and political impasse. The author shows how these failures not only limited India's progress toward economic growth and social justice, but also disrupted the political consensus that had made a stable democracy possible. The new chapters engage critically with the economic liberalization programme that India initiated since 1991.},

To avoid endogeneity bias, if schooling requires some willingness to accept authority, we assess the political and social impacts of a randomized girls' merit scholarship incentive program in Kenya that raised test scores and secondary schooling. We find little evidence for modernization theory. Consistent with the empowerment view, young women in program schools were less likely to accept domestic violence. Moreover, the program increased objective political knowledge, and reduced acceptance of political authority. However, this rejection of the status quo did not translate into greater perceived political efficacy, community participation, or voting intentions. Instead, the perceived legitimacy of political violence increased. Reverse causality may help account for the view that education instills greater acceptance of authority.},

The paper rejects output measures, and suggests a two-dimensional framework of using capacity and autonomy as a measure of executive branch quality. This framework explains the conundrum of why low-income countries are advised to reduce bureaucratic autonomy while high-income ones seek to increase it.},

The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former owners' land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which should help to reduce poverty in future generations.},

  abstract = {Can stronger state-level public policies help protect workers from ``wage theft?'' In recent years, workers' rights groups have responded to policy drift and legislative inaction at the national level by launching campaigns to enact stronger penalties for wage and hour violations at the state level. Many of these campaigns have been legislatively successful and formative for the development of ``alt-labor.'' But are such policies actually effective in deterring wage theft? Previous scholarship has long concluded that although stronger penalties should theoretically make a difference, in practice, they do not. But by confining the analysis to the admittedly weak national-level regulatory regime, the existing literature has eliminated all variation from the costs side of the equation and overlooked the rich variety of employment laws that exist at the state level. Using an original dataset of state laws, new estimates of minimum wage violations, and difference-in-differences analyses of a dozen recently enacted ``wage-theft laws,'' I find that stronger penalties can, in fact, serve as an effective deterrent against wage theft, but the structure of the policy matters a great deal, as does its enforcement. The implications for workers' rights and the changing shape of the labor movement are discussed in detail.},

Drift is a ubiquitous mode of policy change in America's gridlock-prone polity, and its causes are now well understood. Yet surprisingly little attention has been paid to the political consequences of drift\textemdash to the ways in which drift, like the adoption of new policies, may generate its own feedback effects. In this article, we seek to fill this gap. We first outline a set of theoretical expectations about how drift should affect downstream politics. We then examine these dynamics in the context of four policy domains: labor law, health care, welfare, and disability insurance. In each, drift is revealed to be both mobilizing and constraining: While it increases demands for policy innovation, group adaptation, and new group formation, it also delimits the range of possible paths forward. These reactions to drift, in turn, generate new problems, cleavages, and interest alignments that alter subsequent political trajectories. Whether formal policy revision or further stalemate results, these processes reveal key mechanisms through which American politics and policy develop.},

On the demand side, the key institutions are non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations and the news media, both of which require a receptive political and economic climate to function effectively.

Through its impact on investments, individual milestones in turn affect ambient social outcomes. We explore this two-way link. A central feature is that aspirations that are moderately above an individual's cur- rent standard of living tend to encourage investment, while still higher aspirations may lead to frustration and lower investment. When integrated with the feedback effect from investment, we are led to a theory in which aspirations and income evolve jointly, and the social determinants of preferences play an important role. We examine conditions under which growth is compat- ible with long-run equality in the distribution of income. More generally, we describe steady state income distributions, which are typically clustered around local poles. Finally, the theory has predictions for the growth rates along the cross-section of income, and for aggregate growth rates starting from any initial distribution of income.},

Novel items added to a nationally representative survey show that 25 per cent of respondents report not believing their ballot choices are kept secret and over 70 per cent report sharing their vote choices with others. These findings suggest that standard models of candidate choice should account for the potential effects of doubts about ballot secrecy. Consistent with this view, regression analysis shows that social forces appear to have a greater effect on vote choices among people who doubt the formal secrecy of the ballot. This analysis supports the broader claim that the intended benefits of institutional rules may not be realized if people's perceptions of these rules differ from their formal characteristics.},

Based on an extended study of slum enumeration and the politics of slum demolitions in Delhi, I show that each of these two moments relied on an epistemologically different set of calculative practices ? one statistical, the other aesthetic ? to render the slum intelligible and secure rule. I specifically show how the statistically rigorous calculative practices of the first moment encountered various technical difficulties and political challenges in producing a governing intelligibility, thus leading to the unruliness of slum space. In response, a new set of governmental techniques operating through the dissemination of aesthetic norms and codes re-secured rule over slums. I describe this shift in governmental technique to demonstrate that the dissemination of aesthetic norms can be both more governmentally effective and practically implementable than the statistical deployment of governmental truths. This suggests the need to expand our understanding of the epistemology of government to include attention to a more diverse array of governmental technologies, some more aesthetic than strictly calculative.

Analysis of the data decidedly favours the symbolic justice hypothesis. Land redistribution is a symbolic issue for most black South Africans, grounded in values connected to land as a symbol and in concern for the historical injustices of apartheid and colonialism. Because land policy preferences are so strongly associated with concerns for historical injustices against groups, the land issue remains volatile and resistant to `simple' economic solutions. Land is thus an example of historical injustices colliding with demands for contemporary fairness.},

That ruling extended free speech rights to candidates for judicial office, allowing them the freedom to announce their views on a variety of political and legal issues. Coupled with growing campaign contributions by interest groups and the increasing prevalence of attack ads, state judicial elections now often appear to be little different from ordinary political elections. This has caused many to worry about the legitimacy of elected state courts inasmuch as their perceived impartiality appears to be at risk from campaign activity. The purpose of this article is to investigate those concerns, relying upon an experiment embedded within a representative national survey. Four hypotheses about the effects of campaign activity on institutional legitimacy are investigated, including the hypothesis that courts differ little from legislatures in how they are affected by campaigning. The analysis reveals that campaign activity can indeed detract from institutional legitimacy, but the culprit seems to be campaign contributions, not policy talk or even attack ads. Generally, cross- institutional differences are found to be minor; the factors affecting judicial legitimacy have similar effects on legislative legitimacy. No support whatsoever is found for the view that the ruling in White threatens the legitimacy of elected state courts.},

In this article, we use the theory of positivity bias to investigate the preferences of Americans regarding the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.More specifically, from the theory of positivity bias, we derive the hypothesis that preferences on the Alito confirmation are shaped by anterior commitments to the Supreme Court. Based on an analysis of a national panel survey, we find that those who have a high level of loyalty toward the Supreme Court rely much more heavily on what we term judiciousness\textemdash in contrast to ideology, policy, and partisanship\textemdash in forming their opinions on whether to confirm Alito.

To do so, we combine student-level administrative data with novel information about the educational programs of charter schools that opened in North Carolina following the removal of the statewide cap in 2011. The dataset contains students' standardized test scores as well as geocoded residential addresses, which allow us to compare the test score changes of students who lived near the new charters prior to the policy change with those for students who lived farther away. We apply this research design to estimate separate treatment effects for exposure to charter schools that are and are not differentiated horizontally from public school instruction. The results indicate learning gains for treated students that are driven entirely by nonhorizontally differentiated charter schools: we find that non-horizontally differentiated charter school expansion causes a 0.05{$\sigma$} increase in math scores. These learning gains are driven by public schools responding to increased competition.},

This practice is problematic for two reasons: (1) within-country, cross-agency diversity in capacity often overwhelms the variation encountered across public sectors considered in their entireties; (2) national- level reputations for capacity are not particularly informative about differences in capacity in functionally equivalent agencies in different countries.

Specifically, we argue that institutions directly alter- ing the risk of unemployment (employment protection legislation) and those that delink benefits from the labor market create a more uniform system of social risk that reduces the importance of individual-level risk in shaping policy preferences. We test these propositions using multilevel analysis of 19 advanced industrial countries in 2006. We find that individual risk matters for social policy preferences only where employment protection is low and welfare benefits are dependent on employment.},

In particular, growing housing prices permit wealthier individuals to `target' education in ways that exclude lower income citizens. Districts with higher house prices have higher average academic performance but also greater variation in performance and a greater number of schools opting out of local authority control. Moreover, in districts with high variation in school performance, owners of expensive housing are more satisfied with schooling than are non-owners, with the reverse pattern obtaining in districts with low academic variation.},

The paper argues that extant conceptualizations of subnational political regimes, which generally draw on a strategy of ``conceptual expansion'' have important drawbacks for the study of subnational undemocratic regimes (SURs). To overcome these shortcomings, the article claims for a strategy of ``conceptual separation'' that disaggregates political regimes into two orthogonal dimensions, i.e., the access to and the exercise of state power. Drawing on original evidence from Argentina and Mexico, the article dem- onstrates that the strategy of conceptual separation helps researchers to (1) avoid truncation of the universe of cases for analysis, (2) obtain new and more precise information about the actual magnitude of the uneven territorialization of democracy, (3) recognize the existence of two ideal type domains of SURs: patrimonial and bureaucratic, and (4) gain more analytic leverage to identify the causal mechanisms that explain regime continuity within and across SUR types. In-depth case studies of the state of Puebla (Mexico) and the province of San Luis (Argentina) demonstrate empirically the workings of the mechanisms that account for regime continuity in bureaucratic-like SURs. The article also demonstrates the potential of distinguishing between SUR types for the study of SUR origins and SUR change.},

Dictatorship provides stronger incentives to a narrower base. As education raises the benefits of civic engagement, it raises participation in support of a broad-based regime (democ- racy) relative to that in support of a narrow-based regime (dictatorship).

Starting with over 9,000 studies, 79 are selected as being of sufficient quality. Then an even higher bar is set in terms of econometric methods used, leaving 43 ``high quality'' studies. Finally, results are also shown separately for 13 randomized trials. The estimated impacts on time in school and learning of most school and teacher characteristics are statistically insignificant, especially when the evidence is limited to the ``high quality'' studies. The few variables that do have significant effects \textendash{} e.g. availability of desks, teacher knowledge of the subjects they teach, and teacher absence \textendash{} are not particularly surprising and thus provide little guidance for future policies and programs.},

Second, we show that qualitative information can be incorporated in an analysis and presented as qualitative confi- dence intervals. Third, we demonstrate that a standard technique of comparative case studies can improve sensitivity analysis within this framework, sometimes reducing the sensitivity of p-values to unmeasured confounders. Finally, we demonstrate that qualitative information on the heterogeneity of treatments can be used to check the robustness of p-values.

  abstract = {We inventory more than 150 studies of distributive politics in more than three dozen countries other than the United States. We organize existing studies under two theories: theories of democratic accountability and theories of government responsiveness. Studies that concern democratic accountability conceptualize distributive allocations as attempts by politi- cians to protect themselves electorally by targeting specific groups of voters. We identify four subsets: (a) studies of whether politicians target goods to core or swing voters; (b) studies of general political favoritism in targeting government goods; (c) studies of whether goods are disbursed according to the electoral cycle; and (d ) studies of whether elected officials gain votes from the disbursement of government goods.We illustrate each with examples from the literature. We then discuss distributive politics as responsiveness to the median voter. This perspective entails a focus on the redistributive consequences of government policy and investigates whether special interests capture a disproportionate share of goods coming from government. To illustrate the utility of both perspectives, we analyze original data on electricity provision in India's largest state.},

Industries, from 1909 to 1929, with more capital per worker and a greater proportion of motive energy coming from purchased electricity employed relatively more educated blue-collar workers in 1940 and paid their production workers substantially more. We also find a strong positive association between changes in capital intensity and the nonproduction worker wage bill from 1909\textendash 1919 implying capital-skill complementarity as large as in recent years.},

Goldin argues that although recent public and private discourse has brought these concerns to light, the actions taken-such as a single company slapped on the wrist or a few progressive leaders going on paternity leave-are the economic equivalent of tossing a band-aid to someone with cancer. These solutions, Goldin writes, treat the symptoms and not the disease of gender inequality in the workplace and economy. Goldin points to data that reveals how the pay gap widens further down the line in women's careers, about 10 to 15 years out, as opposed to those beginning careers after college. She examines five distinct groups of women over the course of the twentieth century: cohorts of women who differ in terms of career, job, marriage, and children, in approximated years of graduation-1900s, 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s-based on various demographic, labor force, and occupational outcomes. The book argues that our entire economy is trapped in an old way of doing business; work structures have not adapted as more women enter the workforce. Gender equality in pay and equity in home and childcare labor are flip sides of the same issue, and Goldin frames both in the context of a serious empirical exploration that has not yet been put in a long-run historical context. Career and Family offers a deep look into census data, rich information about individual college graduates over their lifetimes, and various records and new sources of material to offer a new model to restructure the home and school systems that contribute to the gender pay gap and the quest for both family and career"--},

It theoretically specifi es and empirically demonstrates which states benefi t during periods of decentralization and centralization. It argues that powerful presidents who centralize resources have imposed greater costs on more developed and fi scally independent dis- tricts (which prefer to administer their own resources and can be serious challengers to presidential power), thus relying mainly on support from less developed and more fi scally dependent provinces, which prefer more redistribution.

Using the concept of `modes of ordering' from Science and Technology Studies, we explore how attempts to impose this rights-based, government-centred order have fared against resistance from the market-based order of the private sector. As more countries express a commitment to a rights-based order, the Indian case study and the concept of `modes of ordering' could help in anticipating and countering the challenges they might face.},

There is large variation in the quality of both school types; and observed school and teacher characteristics are weakly correlated with learning outcomes. There is considerable sorting among students, and those from higher socio-economic strata select into private schools. Private schools have lower pupil-teacher ratios and seven to eight times lower teacher salaries but do not differ systematically in infrastructure and teacher effort from government schools. Most of the variation in teacher effort is within schools and is weakly correlated with observed teacher characteristics such as education, training, experience. After controlling for observed student and school characteristics, the private school advantage over government schools in test scores varies by state, school type and grade. Private unrecognized schools do better than private recognized schools. Given the large salary differential, private schools would clearly be more cost effective even in the case of no absolute difference in test scores.},

  abstract = {Numerous developing countries have substantially increased their number of subnational ad- ministrative units in recent years. The literature on this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small and suffers from several theoretical and methodological shortcomings: in particular, a unit of analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the importance of local actors. We posit that administrative unit proliferation occurs where and when there is a confluence of interests between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas that are politically, economically, and ethnically marginalized. We argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity. We find support for these arguments using original data from Uganda. INTRODUCTION},

Although parents cannot directly buy a middle-class outcome for their children, they can buy opportunity indirectly through advantaged access to the schools, neighborhoods, and information that create merit and raise the probability of a middle-class outcome. The rise of opportunity markets happened so gradually that the country has seemingly forgotten that opportunity was not always sold on the market. If the United States were to recommit to equalizing opportunities, this could be pursued by dismantling opportunity markets, by providing low-income parents with the means to participate in them, or by allocating educational opportunities via separate competitions among parents of similar means. The latter approach, which we focus upon here, would not require mobilizing support for a massive redistributive project.},

  abstract = {We study political economy responses to a large scale intervention in Bangladesh, where four sub-districts consisting of 100 villages (12,000 households) were randomly assigned to control, information or subsidy treatments to encourage investments in improved sanitation. In theory, leaders may endogenously respond to large interventions by changing their allocation of effort, and their constituents' views about the leader may rationally change as a result. In one intervention where the leaders' role in program allocation was not clear to constituents, constituents appear to attribute credit to their local leader for a randomly assigned program. However, when subsidy assignment is clearly and transparently random, the lottery winners do not attribute any extra credit to the politician relative to lottery losers. The theory can rationalize these observations if we model leaders' actions and constituent reactions under imperfect information about leader ability. A third intervention returns to program villages to inform a subset of subsidy recipients that the program was run by NGOs using external funds. This eliminates the excess credit that leaders received from treated households after the first intervention. These results suggest that while politicians may try to take credit for development programs, it is not easy for them do so. Political accountability is not easily undermined by development aid.},

  abstract = {Public health services, which reduce a population's exposure to disease through such measures as sanitation and vector control, are an essential part of a country's development infrastructure. In the developed world and East Asia, systematic public health efforts raised labor productivity and life expectancies well before modern curative technologies became widely available, and helped set the stage for rapid economic growth and poverty reduction. The enormous business and other costs of the breakdown of these services are illustrated by the current global epidemic of avian flu, emanating from poor poultry-keeping practices in a few Chinese villages. For various reasons, mostly of political economy, public funds for health services in India have been focused largely on medical services, and public health services have been neglected. This is reflected in a virtual absence of modern public health regulations, and of systematic planning and delivery of public health services. Various organizational issues also militate against the rational deployment of personnel and funds for disease control. There is strong capacity for dealing with outbreaks when they occur, but not to prevent them from occurring. Impressive capacity also exists for conducting intensive campaigns, but not for sustaining these gains on a continuing basis after the campaign. This is illustrated by the near-eradication of malaria through highly-organized efforts in the 1950s, and its resurgence when attention shifted to other priorities such as family planning. This paper reviews the fundamental obstacles to effective disease control in India, and indicates new policy thrusts which can help overcome these obstacles.},

This article questions this now-conventional wisdom by reconsidering the post-1970s trajectory of the American welfare state, long considered the quintessential case of social policy stability. I demonstrate that although most programs have indeed resisted retrenchment, U.S. social policy has also offered increasingly incomplete risk protection in an era of dramatic social change. Although some of this disjuncture is inadvertent\textemdash an unintended consequence of the very political stickiness that has stymied retrenchment\textemdash I argue that the declining scope of risk protection also reflects deliberate and theoretically explicable strategies of reform adopted by welfare state opponents in the face of popular and change-resistant policies, a finding that has significant implications for the study of institutional change more broadly.},

  abstract = {Today we live in a world of sharp contrasts. There has been great progress in human and economic development. At the same time, deep-seated social and political imbalances continue to constrain opportunities for many of the world's poor. With more than a billion people living on less than a dollar a day, the gap between rich and poor is wide. Millions are also affected by war and other forms of violence, discrimination, or political exclusion. The Social Development Department at the World Bank works to incorporate an understanding of these social, institutional and political factors into development policies, projects and institutions to secure better outcomes on the ground for poor people. With the goal of empowering poor and marginalized women and men, social development is a process of transforming institutions for greater inclusion, cohesion and accountability. There is a need, therefore, to understand better the social context of the country and the factors that drive societies, as well as the needs and priorities of poor people. Poor people's own voices tell us that poverty is more than low income\textemdash it is also about vulnerability, exclusion and isolation, unaccountable institutions, and powerlessness. This Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of on-going social development analysis and practice at the World Bank. Topics include participation and civic engagement, conflict prevention and reconstruction, community-driven development, and social analysis and policy. These reports have had an important impact in disseminating cutting edge research and experience and among development practitioners, governments and civil society across different regions of the world. In this context, we are pleased to introduce a subset of social development working papers from the South Asia region. The South Asia papers capture the policy shifts in the region that are aimed at transforming institutions towards greater inclusion and empowerment of poor people. Each of these papers dwells at some length on the broader policy context of these changes, and is a testimony of the extent to which Social Development has entered the discourse on policy and on transformation of key institutions. The papers cover a range of important topics, from how traditional axes of exclusion (across caste and gender lines) affect labor market outcomes, to a new understanding of one of India's largest anti-poverty programs. The papers often challenge conventional notions of poverty reduction and provide alternative ways of thinking about policy reform. In particular, many of the papers look at how the local state can play a more inclusive and accountable role in the development process to secure better outcomes for the poor. This critical look at the relationship between the state and citizens is an important part of South Asia's Social Development agenda.},

  title = {Democracy and {{Rural Bias}} in {{Sub-Saharan Africa}}},
  author = {Harding, Robin},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The question motivating my dissertation is: why are urbanites in Africa hostile to- wards incumbent governments? Although there is widespread acceptance that African electoral politics is dominated by ethnicity and vote-buying, not by an urban/rural cleavage, urban residents across Africa are significantly less likely to support incum- bents. Inanswering this question, I argue that democracy makes African governments more responsive to rural interests; because a majority of Africans live in rural areas, competitive elections create incentives for governments to implement policies that favor rural interests while ignoring the urban minority, thereby generating dissatis- faction among urban voters. The logical implication of this argument is that this hos- tility should reduce as urbanization increases, because governments gain incentives to more evenly balance pro-rural and pro-urban policies. Importantly, this argument assumes that voters in Africa are responsive to public goods. I investigate the validity of this theoretical argument in three ways. In the first pa- per, I use cross-national survey data to show that while urban residents are less likely to support incumbents, this difference is conditional on the level of urbanization. In the second paper I investigate whether democracy leads to a ``rural bias'' in public goods, using individual level data on education attainment across 29 countries. The results provide strong evidence of a rural bias in the impact of democracy on educa- tion attainment across Africa. Moreover, they show that this rural bias is conditional on the level of urbanization. In the third paper I investigate the argument's foun- dational assumption \textendash{} that citizens in Africa vote on the basis of public goods \textendash{} by analyzing the relationship between presidential vote shares and road conditions in Ghana. Using an original dataset, I show that vote shares are significantly and sub- stantially affected by changes to local road conditions. My findings show that, as the theory predicts, democracy has a positive impact on the provision of rural public goods. In addition, they demonstrate that African politics is not only about ethnicity and vote-buying; voters in Africa care about public goods, and therefore elections create incentives for incumbents to target resources to the rural majority, which generates hostility fromurban residents.},

  abstract = {Does democracy affect the provision of basic services? We advance on existing empirical work on this subject by exploring the potential mechanisms through which a democratic transition may prompt a government to alter provision of basic services to its citizens. In an environment of weak state capacity, in which it is di\textcent{} cult for voters to attribute outcomes to executive actions, we suggest that electoral competition is most likely to lead to changes in policies where executive action is verildotsable. Considering the context of African primary education as an example, we suggest that electoral competition will therefore give governments an incentive to abolish school fees, but it will have less e\textcurrency ect on the provision of school inputs, precisely because executive actions on these issues are more di\textcent{} cult to monitor. We evaluate this claim by approaching it in three di\textcurrency erent ways, using cross-national as well as individual level data, including an original data set on primary school fee abolitions. First we show that in Africa, democracies have higher rates of school attendance than non-democracies. Moreover, evidence suggests that this is primarily due to the fact that democracies are more likely to abolish school fees, not to the fact that they provide more inputs. We then estimate the likelihood that a government will abolish school fees subsequent to an election, taking account of endogeneity concerns involving election timing. Finally, we use survey data from Kenya to provide evidence suggesting that citizens condition their voting intentions on an outcome that a politician can control directly, in this case abolishing school fees, but not on outcomes over which politicians have much more indirect in\textdaggerdbl uence, such as local school quality.},

In particular, the paper explores the issue of whether private provision is affordable and accessible to poor rural parents. It finds that LFP school costs are unaffordable for over half of the sampled children, including the majority of low caste and Muslim families. It also finds that while LFPs are greatly preferred under current conditions, what parents actually want is a well-functioning government school system.},

This is often the case where government is not providing enough school places, but also where parents could access government schools for their children but choose not to, due to perceived low quality of provision. This research study sought to find out if non-state schooling has developed to any considerable extent in the Mozambican context, where government education is of poor quality and learning outcomes are low. This paper reports that non-state provision is playing some role in providing places at the secondary level where government under-provides, and it is providing differentiated demand for some primary pupils. The study finds that the only level at which a true market appears to be developing is at the pre-primary level where government does not provide at all, which has resulted in complete inequity in access to early learning opportunities. At this most crucial level most schools are established, owned and run like typical low-fee private schools, i.e. as small businesses with individual owners. Overall non-government schools are few and far between and are playing a small role, with the only indications of recent growth evident at the pre-primary level.},

There appears an equal decline in the ability of existing structures of representation to provide participation, focusing in particular on ways in which poorer social groups organise, obtain political representation and try to solve collective social problems. It appears, contrary to most groups appear to have a limited capacity to present a reform agenda that addresses issues of basic rights and ensures livelihoods. To test this hypothesis, this paper studies sample communities in Delhi, representative of a broad cross section of the population. Through an analysis of the data collected, the study describes and explains patterns of political poorer social groups influence over policy. On the other hand, there is also evidence of a crisis in popular representation in several low- and middle-income countries. Poorer social expectations, that the needs and interest of poorer people are increasingly being met through the 'new politics' of social movements, the poor in particular still seek to represent themselves and to tackle their problems through political parties.},

The effects are largest for male students entering high school, whose truancy rates decline by 21\% in the months after winning the lottery. We then examine the impact attending a chosen school has on student test score outcomes. We find substantial test score gains from attending a charter school and some evidence that choosing and attending a high value-added magnet school improves test scores as well. Our results contribute to current evidence that school choice programs can effectively raise test scores of participants. Our findings suggest that this may occur both through an immediate effect on student behavior and through the benefit of attending a higher-performing school.},

The implications of these arguments for the applicability of partisan theory are presented, and theoretical and empirical issues are identified for further research.},

We randomized at both the village and household levels; furthermore, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife versus husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer versus monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (US\$404 PPP versus US\$1,525 PPP). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from \$158 PPP to \$193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, whereas lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on economic outcomes and psychological well-being.},

Leveraging examples of retro- spective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well- known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research.We discuss two additional issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between retrospec- tive voting behavior and policy outcomes. 285},

In this article we develop a framework for studying informal institutions and integrating them into comparative institutional analysis. The framework is based on a typology of four patterns of formal- informal institutional interaction: complementary, accommodating, competing, and substitutive.We then explore two issues largely ignored in the literature on this subject: the reasons and mechanisms behind the emergence of informal institutions, and the nature of their stability and change. Finally, we consider challenges in research on informal institutions, including issues of identification, measurement, and comparison.},

There, the interaction of power and space is dramatically different from what occurred in Europe. In his groundbreaking book, Jeffrey Herbst places the African state-building process in a truly comparative perspective, examining the problem of state consolidation from the precolonial period, through the short but intense interlude of European colonialism, to the modern era of independent states. Herbst's bold contention--that the conditions now facing African state-builders existed long before European penetration of the continent--is sure to provoke controversy, for it runs counter to the prevailing assumption that colonialism changed everything.   In identifying how the African state-building process differs from the European experience, Herbst addresses the fundamental problem confronting African leaders: how to extend authority over sparsely settled lands. Indeed, efforts to exert control over vast, inhospitable territories of low population density and varied environmental and geographical zones have resulted in devastating wars, millions of refugees, and dysfunctional governments perpetrating destructive policies.   Detailing the precise political calculations of distinct African leaders, Herbst isolates the basic dynamics of African state development. In analyzing how these leaders have attempted to consolidate power, he is able to evaluate a variety of policy alternatives for dealing with the fundamental political challenges facing African states today.},

This method of contingent exchange thrives in both autocracies and democracies. It exists in a large variety of cultural contexts. Confronted with economic develop- ment, clientelism fades away in some political contexts but adapts and survives in others. This article explores our understanding of the ori- gins and dynamics of clientelism, focusing on the relationships between clientelism and democracy and between clientelism and development. It then evaluates the connection between clientelism and a variety of political and economic outcomes, including democratic accountability, corruption, and public goods provision. It concludes by outlining some remaining empirical and theoretical challenges and highlighting recent innovations in data collection and empirical methods.},

Objective To compare quality-of-care measures for investor-owned and not-for- profit HMOs. Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Version 3.0 from the National Committee for Quality Assur- ance's Quality Compass 1997, which included 1996 quality-of-care data for 329HMO plans (248 investor-owned and 81 not-for-profit), representing56\%of the totalHMO enrollment in the United States. Main Outcome Measures Rates for 14 HEDIS quality-of-care indicators. Results Compared with not-for-profit HMOs, investor-owned plans had lower rates for all 14 quality-of-care indicators. Among patients discharged from the hospital af- ter myocardial infarction, 59.2\% of members in investor-owned HMOs vs 70.6\% in not-for-profit plans received a ?-blocker (P?.001); 35.1\% of patients with diabetes mellitus in investor-owned plans vs 47.9\% in not-for-profit plans had annual eye ex- aminations (P?.001). Investor-owned plans had lower rates than not-for-profit plans of immunization (63.9\% vs 72.3\%; P?.001), mammography (69.4\% vs 75.1\%; P?.001), Papanicolaou tests (69.2\% vs 77.1\%; P?.001), and psychiatric hospitaliza- tion (70.5\% vs 77.1\%; P?.001). Quality scores were highest for staff- and group- model HMOs. In multivariate analyses, investor ownership was consistently associ- ated with lower quality after controlling for model type, geographic region, and the method each HMO used to collect data. Conclusions Investor-owned HMOs deliver lower quality of care than not-for- profit plans.},

A brief history of the modern system of states is followed ? rst by an account of liberalism as a project of government emerging within that system, and secondly by an examination of how twentieth-century changes in the system of states have impacted on that liberal project. Where the liberal government of non-Western populations was once predicated on a denial of citizenship it is now channelled through the promotion of citizenship in states that are themselves increasingly subject to the rigours of the market.

Hirschman was a master essayist, one who possessed the rare ability to blend the precision of economics with the elegance of literary imagination. In an age in which our academic disciplines require ever-greater specialization and narrowness, it is rare to encounter an intellectual who can transform how we think about inequality by writing about traffic, or who can slip in a quote from Flaubert to reveal something surprising about taxes. The essays gathered here span an astonishing range of topics and perspectives, including industrialization in Latin America, imagining reform as more than repair, the relationship between imagination and leadership, routine thinking and the marketplace, and the ways our arguments affect democratic life. Throughout, we find humor, unforgettable metaphors, brilliant analysis, and elegance of style that give Hirschman such a singular voice. Featuring an introduction by Jeremy Adelman that places each of these essays in context as well as an insightful afterword by Emma Rothschild and Amartya Sen, The Essential Hirschman is the ideal introduction to Hirschman for a new generation of readers and a must-have collection for anyone seeking his most important writings in one book"--},

Empirical evidence from most of these countries however indicates that the neo-liberal policies have not been very successful in including the excluded in the mainstream development process. The paper observes that there is an urgent need to give a fresh look at the macroeconomic framework underlying the present policies. To start with, there is a need to end the tug of war between the growth and redistribution phases of neo-liberal policies. This is because the mainstream growth process that creates exclusion as well as inequalities tends to overpower the redistribution process and intensifies exclusions. The macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and monetary policies will have to play a much larger role in achieving developmental goals. There is also a need to expand the boundaries of macroeconomics to include natural resources as well as unpaid work within its purview to make it relevant and real.},

We use this differential impact to measure the effects of unrestricted choice on educational outcomes. Using panel data for about 150 municipalities, we find no evidence that choice improved average educational outcomes as measured by test scores, repetition rates, and years of schooling. However, we find evidence that the voucher program led to increased sorting, as the bbestQ public school students left for the private sector.},

The second dimension contrasts a fractionalization perspective (which assumes that more groups or parties cause more problems) with a polarization perspective (which assumes that problems are greatest when there are two equal-sized groups or parties).Using survey data to implement the measures in 43 countries, the article shows that proportional electoral laws are associatedwith lower levels of ethnicization\textemdash the opposite ofwhat iswidely assumed.

Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this ``fishing'' problem in medical studies, leading journals now require pre- registration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced specification, the scope for fishing is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete ``mock report'' of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and propose that a comprehensive but nonbinding approach be adopted as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely effects of comprehensive but nonbinding registration are discussed, the principal advantage being communication rather than commit- ment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.},

Yet these factors have been counterbalanced by the strong political influence and lobbying power of organized interests with a stake in preexisting arrangements of social protection and human capital formation. An analysis of four key federal sectors, social security, education, health care, and public assistance, illustrates the chal- lenges for social sector reforms that go beyond raising basic living standards to enhancing socioeconomic inequality.

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, ``Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model'' (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, ``Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, CL , Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set'', Annals of Statistics, 15, 958\textendash 975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, ``Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections'', Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675\textendash 697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

Second, researchers link the theoretical concept of equilibrium with cointegration and error correction models. Third, analysts often do a poor job of interpreting results. The consequences include weak connections between theory and tests, biased estimates, and incorrect inferences.We outline techniques for estimating linear dynamic regressions with stationary data and weakly exogenous regressors.We recommend analysts (1) start with general dynamic models and test restrictions before adopting a particular specification and (2) use the wide array of information available from dynamic specifications.We illustrate this strategy with data on Congressional approval and tax rates across OECD countries.

Furthermore, it is proposed in this article that examining social movements for their labour content can reveal erosions of working conditions and worker power in informal sector employment. A case study of the Paris garment district is presented to demonstrate how the spread of `hybrid-informality' made legal work permits a prerequisite for working informally and relegated undocumented immigrants to lower quality jobs outside the cluster.},

The result has everywhere been a decline in coordinated wage bargaining and unionization and a notable rise in labor market inequality. Yet, the political responses have been very different across advanced democracies. While labor markets for part-time and temporary employment have been deregulated across the board, some countries have compensated losers through increased cash transfers and active labor market programs and others have allowed inequality and insider-outsider divisions to grow deeper. The article argues that the divergent government responses reflect differences in underlying electoral coalitions, and that these in turn mirror the structure of party and electoral systems. The authors support their argument with evidence for government responses to economic shocks in the period 1980 to 2010.},

Recent research identifies significant class gaps in parental investments that contribute to high levels of inequality by family income and education and, potentially, to inequality in children's development. State-level public investments in children and families have the potential to reduce class inequality in children's developmental environments by affecting parents' behavior. Using newly assembled administrative data from 1998-2014, linked to household-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we examine how public sector investment in income support, health and education is associated with the private expenditures of low and high-SES parents on developmental items for children. Are class gaps in parental investments in children narrower in contexts of higher public investment for children and families? We find that more generous public spending for children and families is associated with significantly narrower class gaps in private parental investments. Moreover, we find that equalization is driven by bottom up increases in low-SES household spending for the progressive investments of income support and health, and by top down decreases in high-SES household spending for the universal investment of public education.},

Schattschneider's observation that ``a new policy creates a new politics,'' scholars of ``policy feedback'' have theorized that policies influence subsequent political behavior and public opinion. Recent studies observe, however, that policy feedback does not always occur and the form it takes varies considerably. To explain such variation, we call for policy feedback studies to draw more thoroughly on public opinion research. We theorize that: (1) feedback effects are not ubiquitous and may in some instances be offset by political factors, such as partisanship and trust in government; (2) policy design may generate selfinterested or sociotropic motivations, and (3) feedback effects result not only from policy benefits but also from burdens. We test these expectations by drawing on a unique panel study of Americans' responses to the Affordable Care Act. We find competing policy and political pathways, which produce variations in policy feedback.},

Such initiatives included building schools, training teachers, providing school-meals at noon, revising textbooks etc.. In India too, several policy initiatives have been undertaken over the years. A recent intervention is the District Primary Education Program (DPEP). Under the DPEP, efforts were made to design project components that would reduce gaps in enrollments, dropouts and learning achievements across gender and disadvantaged social groups. By December 2001, over 1.5 billion US dollars had been committed to the project and the school system under DPEP was expected to cover more than 50 million children. Question is whether the DPEP was successful in increasing enrollment rates particularly among the targeted groups and/or in improving quality of learning of the already enrolled children. Our estimates show some impacts on enrollments of the socially disadvantaged minority groups (the scheduled tribe and scheduled caste) especially in one specific state where concurrent to the DPEP, another state government-supported primary school initiative was also started. Contrary to the stated objectives of the program, however, there was no closing of the gender gap either in terms of enrollments or with respect to educational achievements.},

I argue that the latter is due to differentiated demand and nonprofit supply, both of which stem from cultural heterogeneity, especially religious heteroge- neity. In contrast, the large \%PVT at the secondary level in developing countries is hypothesized to stem from limited public spending, which creates an "excess demand" from people who would prefer to use the public schools but are involuntarily excluded and pushed into the private sector. The limited public spending on secondary education, in turn, is modelled as a collective decision which is strongly influenced by the many families who opt for quantity over quality of children, in devel- oping countries. The results of regressions that determine private sector size recursively and simultaneously with public educational spending are consistent with these hypotheses.},

Quantitative survey results allow us to reject the hypothesis that improving access to information would increase knowledge and shift behavior to less risky sexual activities. In fact, we find that the service led to an increase in promiscuity, and no shift in perception of norms. Qualitative focus groups discussions support the findings of the quantitative survey results.

The formation of NGOs appears to be a response to perceptions of need that are so far removed from the local level that they fail to prioritize amongst levels and locations of poverty. In the absence of objective feedback mechanisms, the global*and therefore indiscriminate*perspective of international funding sources may help explain the lack of correspondence between need and NGO location, combined with the inevitably limited and blinkered knowledge of regional disparities that can be obtained through local NGOs. This preliminary ``epistemological'' approach to the question of the sub-optimal formation of NGOs is buttressed by consideration of the factors that may bring perception, reality, and organizational responses into better alignment when natural disasters occur, namely the factors that make natural disasters compelling news stories, unlike chronic underdevelopment.},

Thus, the number of NGOs formed in an area is an ecological-level characteristic that may create the impression of self- interestedness, but one that is not necessarily inconsistent with the altruism of the individuals involved.},

Based on over forty-five interviews with philanthropists, foundation heads, philanthropic organizations and experts in India, and drawing on existing literature and reports, it provides a more balanced view obtained from a range of perspectives. It traces motivations as shaped by cultural traditions and religion, inter- group mistrust, business background and source of wealth, public and peer pressure, and the regulatory and policy environment. The result is a large number of operational foundations within politically `safe' sectors such as education, and under-investment in research and philanthropic infrastructure. A desire for uniqueness has come at the cost of coordination between philanthropic actors, while traditional religious giving has continued, privately, alongside more public formal giving. While pointing to some positive and negative outlooks for the sector, this study will be of interest to those looking to engage with or leverage Indian philanthropy.},

I model and present empirical evidence on these effects, using survey and test score data from Nepal. The evidence suggests that when schools offer for-profit tutoring, teachers teach less during the regular school day. As a consequence, performance on the national secondary-school exam appears to suffer among students with a low propensity to enroll in tutoring. An implication is that discouraging teachers from tutoring their own students or reducing entry barriers for third-party tutors could increase student achievement.},

Unless national and state policies specifically target resources to address these disparities, achieving higher level outcomes in an inclusive manner, which is the real goal for human development in education and health, will be a distant dream. This paper takes up the case of the Indian government's Elementary Education for All Mission to understand how this flagship program relates investments to spatial and social disparities. For identifying the most deprived districts in terms of educational inputs, outputs and overall development, the authors estimate district level education development indices for 2003\textendash 2004. The contribution of the largest investment program is measured by ``per child allocations'' and expenditures at the state and district levels for 2005\textendash 2006. An analysis of comparing the ratio of allocations to expenditures with the ratio of district level indices to sub-dimensional indices shows that there is an apparent disconnect between the ``real investment needs'' of the districts, reflected in their level of educational development and the actual allocations made on an annual basis. The analysis shows that although all districts received more funds for investing in elementary education programs, the most disadvantaged and needy districts received proportionately more funds, which helped these districts to bridge access and infrastructure gaps and appoint more teachers. Benchmarking sector development by spatial entities helps not only in monitoring the outcomes, but also in targeting planning and funding to reduce disparities.},

Hirschman shows that exit and voice are the two main responses to dissatisfaction, with voice being more effective and desirable. His core claims are that a lack of exit opportunities increases voice, and loyalty reduces exit. The exit, voice, and loyalty (EVL) framework is very suitable for understanding how public services can perform effectively and responsively, as there are a range of exits and voices available to citizens and employees when they are dissatisfied. Though there are extensive citations of Hirschman, relatively few scholars fully apply the framework. The main exceptions are the literatures on urban services and on intentions to exit by public employees. Yet the topics of service quality, performance, competition, choice, and participation continue to be of core interest to scholars of public administration. Hirschman's insights and framework foster understanding of the relationships between different kinds of citizen responses to dissatisfaction and how to achieve better-quality public services.},

Identity, affiliations, and access to resources continue to be defined by one's place within a social order that is largely constituted by the ascribed relationships of family, kinship, and community. These `given' relationships pervade all spheres of society and render irrelevant the idea of an impersonal public sphere that individuals enter as bearers of rights, equal in the eyes of the law. This paper explores the proposition that the possibility of belonging to alternative associations whose membership is chosen rather than ascribed by social position offers pathways to a more democratic social order. Bangladesh offers an interesting context to explore this proposition both because it embodies many of the problems of bad governance outlined above and because it contains a large number of civil society associations, many of which work primarily with the poor. The paper is based on interviews with members of some of these organizations in rural and urban areas of the country.},

After the propensity-score matching process takes into account preadult experiences and influences in place during the senior year of high school, the effects of higher education per se on participation disappear. Our results thus call for a reconsideration of how scholars understand the positive empirical relationship between higher education and participation: that higher education is a proxy for preadult experiences and influences, not a cause of political participation.},

Using a survey of school choice participants in a strategic setting, we show that beliefs about admissions chances differ from rational expectations values and predict choice behavior. To quantify the welfare costs of belief errors, we estimate a model of school choice that incorporates subjective beliefs. We evaluate the equilibrium effects of switching to a strategy-proof deferred acceptance algorithm, and of improving households' belief accuracy. Allowing for belief errors reverses the welfare comparison to favor the deferred acceptance algorithm.},

  number = {August},
  abstract = {Independent India's commitment to democratic politics meant that its polity had to grapple with the harsh reality of India's poverty: the sheer number of the poor (who were also now voters), the intensity of poverty and destitution and a deeply stratified and hierarchical society. Addressing the needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups in society has preoccupied the energies of intellectuals and policy makers and a focus of political rhetoric in India to a degree that is uncommon among developing countries. India has deployed a vast array of programs with different instruments and objectives. Yet, notwithstanding their decidedly modest record, India has persisted with ever new cycles of poverty programs. What explains the continual failure and why does India persist with these programs? This paper attempts to address this puzzle by first examining the range of poverty programs that the Indian state has employed to improve the welfare of its many marginalized and vulnerable citizens. We first provide a typology of the more important of these interventions and then examine both the rationale underpinning these interventions and their outcomes based primarily on the evaluations by Indian state agencies. We then focus on the principal reasons for the failure of these programs locating them in key characteristics of India's political economy. We argue that all poverty programs must necessarily pass through the eve of the needle \textendash{} local public administration, where all anti-poverty programs are implemented. The chronic weakness of local public administration pretty much ensures that successful poverty programs will only be an exception and poor performance the rule. We further argue that the weakness of local public administration is partially endogenous to the structure of electoral incentives, which has contributed to an electoral equilibrium. While the political imperatives driving targeted poverty programs despite chronic failure are not surprising, what is more puzzling \textendash{} and needs explanation \textendash{} is less why these countless targeted interventions have performed poorly, but rather why the state, international agencies and India's intellectual class persist in reposing faith in these instruments. Finally the paper examines alternatives and why they have not been tried. ii},

Politicians and builders allegedly engage in a quid pro quo, whereby the former park their illicit assets with the latter, and the latter rely on the former for favorable dispensation. At election time, however, builders need to re-route funds to politicians as a form of indirect election finance. One observable implication is that the demand for cement, the indispensible raw material used in the sector, should contract during elections since builders need to inject funds into campaigns. Using a novel monthly-level data set, we demonstrate that cement consumption does exhibit a political business cycle consistent with our hypothesis. Additional tests provide confidence in the robustness and interpretation of our findings.},

We argue that the potential tax exposure of the rich explains the positive relationship between income and voting in some places and not others. Where the rich anticipate taxation, they have a greater incentive to participate in politics, and politicians are more likely to use fiscal policy to gain support. We explore two factors affecting the tax exposure of the rich\textemdash the political salience of redistribution in party politics and the state's extractive capacity. Using survey data from developed and developing countries, we demonstrate that the rich turn out to vote at higher rates when the political preferences of the rich and poor diverge and where bureaucratic capacity is high.},

Citizens pay bribes, often for benefits for which they already qualify, and much (but not all) of that money is passed on to officials by the middleman. On its face such arrangements would seem to benefit no one but the middleman himself, but closer examination shows that middleman corruption involves much more than a discrete material transaction. There are important intangible dimensions: officials' status is reaffirmed, while for citizens government takes on a comprehensible human face. These dimensions of corruption become all the more important over time, for both reputational capital and expectations are built up that shape future transactions. Most important, middlemen reduce transaction costs for citizens and officials alike. Thus, while middleman corruption falls far short of the ideal sorts of market, government and personal systems of ``micro-coordination'' assumed in many accounts of the effects of corruption, it may well be a better way of getting things done than most of the alternatives actually available. The analysis yields a more subtle but precise view of how cultural factors \textendash{} especially mediating social institutions \textendash{} figure into the study of corruption, and may suggest reasons why extensive corruption and solid economic growth have coexisted in India for decades.

The general equilibrium labor market effects are substantial: they depress the returns to skill and dampen the increase in economic benefits. These GE effects have distributional consequences across cohorts and skill groups, where as a result of the policy unskilled workers are better off and skilled workers are worse off. In the education sector, more private schools enter these markets negating concerns of crowd-out.

In order to mitigate these political compulsions, several federations around the world have attempted to create independent constitutional bodies that are responsible for determining federal transfers to subnational jurisdictions. Khemani tests whether constitutional rules indeed make a difference in curbing political influence by contrasting the impact of political variables on two types of intergovernmental transfers to states in the Indian federation over a period of time, 1972-95. The pattern of evidence shows that transfers, whose regional distribution is determined by political agents, usually provide greater resources to state governments that are politically affiliated with the national ruling party and are important in maximizing the party's representation in the national legislature. But the political effect on statutory transfers, determined by an independent agency with constitutional authority, is strikingly contrary, with greater resources going to unaffiliated state governments. The author argues that this contrasting evidence indicates that constitutional rules indeed restrict the extent to which partisan politics can affect resources available to subnational governments.},

  abstract = {Tis paper uses unique survey data to provide, for the first time in the literature, direct evidence that vote buying in poor economies is associated with lower provision of public services that disproportionately benefit the poor. Various features of the data and the institutional context allow the interpretation of this correlation as the equilibrium policy consequence of clientelist politics, ruling out alternate explanations (such as, for example, poverty driving both vote buying and health outcomes). Te data come from the Philippines, a country context that allows for measuring vote buying during elections and services delivered by the administrative unit controlled by winners of those elections. Te data reveal a significant, robust negative correlation between vote buying and the delivery of primary health services. In places where households report more vote buying, government records show that municipalities invest less in basic health services for mothers and children; and, quite strikingly, as a summary measure of weak service delivery performance, a higher percentage of children are severely under-weight.},

Consequently, social scientists are perpetually seeking to expand upon their knowledge of what factors are associated with voting, or the lack thereof. Commonly identified factors including age, income, race, and educational attainment have been studied extensively. However, while the quantity of education is deemed important, the type of education is overlooked. The limited literature that exists on the topic suggests that private schools have a positive effect on civic outcomes, including voter participation. In using a rich, nationally representative dataset\textemdash the Understanding America Study based out of the University of Southern California\textemdash this study reexamines whether attending a private school has an effect on whether Americans vote. It also sheds light on a heretofore-unanswered question: How does private schooling affect which candidate an individual supports? Overall, the data indicate that private schooling appears to have no impact on voter turnout, but that attending some private school appears to have a liberalizing effect.},

In his latest book, Atul Kohli, a seasoned scholar of Indian politics and economics, blames this discrepancy on the narrow nature of the ruling alliance in India that, in its newfound relationship with business, has prioritized economic growth above all other social and political considerations. In fact, according to Kohli, the resulting inequalities have limited the impact of growth on poverty alleviation, and the exclusion of such a significant proportion of Indians from the fruits of rapid economic growth is in turn creating an array of new political problems. This thoughtful and challenging book affords an alternative vision of India, \"A\^os rise in the world that its democratic rulers will be forced to come to grips with in the years ahead"--},

This paper reviews the main mechanisms through which transparency can reduce corruption. It argues that transparency is insufficient in itself, and needs to be complemented by other types of policies. Transparency reform should focus on the areas most important to alleviating the resource curse. In view of the resource curse literature, the emphasis of the EITI on revenues rather than on expenditures appears misplaced.},

I use exogenous shocks to Brazilian municipalities' revenue during 1995\textendash 2008 generated by non-linearities in federal transfer laws to demonstrate two things. First, municipalities with higher income inequality or higher median income allocate less of a revenue shock to education and are less likely to expand public school enrollment. They are more likely to invest in public infrastructure that is broadly enjoyed, like parks and roads, or to save the shock. Second, I find no evidence that the quality of public education suffers as a result. If anything, unequal and high-income areas are more likely to improve public school inputs and test scores following a revenue shock, given their heavy use of private education. I further provide evidence that an increase in public sector revenue lowers private school enrollment.},

  abstract = {What is new in the current renewed emphasis on the role of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the development process is the emerging view in global corporate sectors, shared in large measure by Rajiv Gandhi's government, according to which a freshly conceived private sector, including the NGOs, provide the new frontier of a dynamic technological integration of the world economy. This is to be achieved through a wide diffusion of liberalised, privatised efforts that is then drawn towards a single market for which the vast hinterlands are opened up, new (including intermediate) technologies are introduced in them and a high rate of economic surplus is generated for the metropolitan regions and the export market, all this done efficiently, cost-effectively through cheap labour and raw materials, and in the framework of a competitive ethos which the principle of the market provides and which the state cannot. It is this that is new-the rapacious drive of a transnationalised, technology-driven, capitalism which has also discovered that the earlier avenues of investment in urban industries like textiles, machine goods, steel, etc, are gradually drying up or getting too competitive and there is need to look for new frontiers that lie deep in the countryside. The earlier 'commanding heights' are giving place to new ones. For the former the state and its agencies were alright, in fact in some ways better than the private sector as the required investment in massive infrastructures could only be provided by the state. But for the latter the agencies of the state will not do. Hence, yet another shift in capitalist thinking on the role of the state.},

Yet because gov- ernments can favor constituencies through the targeting of multiple public and private goods, drawing general conclusions about distributive politics by investigating just one (or even a few) good(s) can be misleading.We demonstrate the severity of this problem by investigating a particular manifestation of distributive politics\textemdash ethnic favoritism\textemdash in a particular setting\textemdash Africa\textemdash and show that the conclusions one draws about who benefits from government allocation decisions can vary markedly depending on the outcome one happens to study. Our findings suggest the need for caution in making general claims about who benefits from dis- tributive politics and raise questions about extant theoretical conclusions that are based on empirical work that focuses on a single distributive outcome.The findings also provide a foundation for a new research agenda aimed at identifying the reasons why polit- ical leaders choose to favor their supporters with some public and private goods rather than others},

We use data on the educational attainment of more than fifty thousand Kenyans dating back to the colonial era, as well as information about the ethnic identities of Kenyan presidents, cabinet members, and highlevel education bureaucrats since the 1960s. Consistent with previous work, we find that having a coethnic as president during one's school-age years is associated with an increase in the schooling that children acquire. In contrast to recent studies, we find that multiparty political competition has no impact on the degree of ethnic favoritism in the education sector. We also go beyond prior work in three ways. First, we show that coethnics of the minister of education also acquire more schooling than children from other ethnic groups \textemdash{} evidence that ministerial appointments come with real power to impact distributive politics. Second, we investigate the effects of coethnicity using different definitions of the president's ethnic community and provide evidence that the beneficiaries of ethnic favoritism can shift with the introduction of democratic electoral competition. Third, we examine several mechanisms through which having a coethnic president might matter and find much greater support for mechanisms emphasizing the supply of inputs to coethnics than those emphasizing the demand by coethnics for greater educational opportunities.},

Absence rates varied from 15\% in Maharashtra to 42\% in Jharkhand, with higher rates concentrated in the poorer states.We do not find that higher pay is associated with lower absence. Older teachers, more educated teachers, and head teachers are all paid more but are also more frequently absent; contract teachers are paid much less than regular teachers but have similar absence rates; and although relative teacher salaries are higher in poorer states, absence rates are also higher. Teacher absence is more correlated with daily incentives to attend work: teachers are less likely to be absent at schools that have been inspected recently, that have better infrastructure, and that are closer to a paved road. We find little evidence that attempting to strengthen local community ties will reduce absence. Teachers from the local area have similar absence rates as teachers from outside the community. Locally controlled nonformal schools have slightly higher absence rates than schools run by the state government. The existence of a PTA is not correlated with lower absence. Private-school teachers are only slightly less likely to be absent than public-school teachers in general, but are 8 percentage points less likely to be absent than public-school teachers in the same village.

What agencies do they utilize in order to have their voices heard and grievances addressed? How do they gain access to government agencies responsible for delivering social welfare services, such as education, security, health care, and poverty relief? Investigations conducted in two states of India inquired about the manner in which different social groups living in rural areas gain access to the welfare services of the Indian state. These results show that an intermediary is required for gaining access. Different types of intermediaries are consulted by separate segments of society. For a large majority of poorer individuals, a newly arisen type of mediator, the naya neta (literally, new leader), is the intermediary of choice. Neither usually low status nor high status, but younger and better educated than other types of village leaders, naya netas play important roles in shaping welfare consequences in these villages of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, most importantly, by affecting equity of access.},

Not only being a rural village, but being located at a substantial distance from cities, has great importance for good governance. Analysis of household data from different parts of rural India shows how villages at greater distances to towns tend to have lower scores on multiple governance dimensions. Even after controlling for diverse influences, using both ordinary least square and multilevel regression models, this gradient of governance remains significant, imposing a dual penalty. Already penalised by markets, which have disproportionately rewarded urban and peri-urban areas, residents of villages located further from towns also experience and expect to receive worse treatment from government.}

It is becoming increasingly clear that a high-variance society is the likely outcome. More than 80\% of the population in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, and Sri Lanka lives in rural areas. The old distinction between the First and Third Worlds is undergoing a transformation. The world's richest and poorest are to be found not on different continents, as before, but increasingly within the borders of the fastest-growing developing countries. Those who live like rich Australians are found in the biggest cities; those who live like the poorest Malawians are found in rural areas, with many making their way into urban slums.},

However, most participants become less satisfied following their hearings, as initial hopes are dashed against the constraints of local policing. The study highlights the promise and limits of formal complaints  mechanisms, which can amplify citizens' voices but-when coupled with an expectations gap-can also deepen grievances.

A number of municipalities are tightly controlled by political dynasties and, thus, I can test whether the effects are dependent upon the political environment. In a compet- itive political environment, incumbent vote share is 26 percentage-points higher in municipalities where the program was implemented in all villages than in municipalities where the program was implemented in half of them. The program had no impact in municipalities with low levels of political competition. Further, there is evidence consistent with the argument that incumbents compensated households in control villages by redistributing their own budget there.},

While several studies suggest a U-shaped relationship between development and women's labor force participation, our results suggest that at the state level, there is no systematic U-shaped relationship between level of domestic product and women's LFPR. On examining the relationship between the structure of the economy and women's economic activity, we find that it is not economic growth but rather the composition of growth that is relevant for women. Further, our results suggest that aggregate changes in the proportion of women in the workforce can be mostly attributed to the movement of the workforce across sectors rather than changes in the proportion of women workers within a sector.},

Their rise has coincided with the emergence, in the post-apartheid period, of a\textemdash mostly black\textemdash middle class. However, despite its imprecision, the `affordable' terminology can also be interpreted as a discursive device that obscures the class interests and distributional choices that actually shape South Africa's education system. It allows the social forces in favour of the expansion of private education\textemdash segments of the state and pro-market lobbyists\textemdash to frame their project in social justice terms. The paper concludes that the state's ambiguous position towards the so-called `affordable' or `low-fee' private schools reflects national leaders'delicate balancing act between contradictory objectives, which is overly determined by their embrace of an orthodox macro-economic model that constrains the fiscal space for public education.},

A powerful antibusing movement based in Charlotte's white-collar suburbs defended neighborhood schools through a color-blind discourse that evaded the historical roots of residential segregation and shaped the legal stance of the Nixon administration. Despite the grassroots revolt of this SilentMajority, Charlotte ultimately achieved one of the most racially integrated school systems in the nation because of a metropolitan remedy that in- cluded the suburbs in a landmark two-way busing plan. This case study of suburban political mobilization challenges the distinction between de jure segregation in the South and de facto segregation in the North and argues that the color-blind populism in metropolitan Charlotte helped to forge a national suburban blueprint of consumer rights, residential privileges, and middle-class racial innocence.},

This article explains the distinguishing factors between formal and informal institutions. It addresses five basic types of informal institutions, examines the ways in which they function and discusses their relevance in terms of democracy theory. Each type is characterized by the way in which it enacts its respective means of political influence. The study distinguishes between forms of specific relationship (clientelism), of material exchange (corruption), of violent exertion of influence (putsch threat), of civil resistance (civil disobedience) and of legal practice (custom law), and discusses their relevance to democracy. The central argument maintains that a differentiated study of informal institutions is crucial to addressing this question. The necessary typological differentiation allows us to make an appropriate assessment - one that does not manifest itself in a simple clear-cut choice of affirmative or negative answers.},

Male out-migration brings economic benefits to the families in places of origin, but also leads to profound changes in the lives of the left-behind wives.

Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey (2004\textendash 2005 and 2011\textendash 2012), we estimated lagged dependent variable models (N = 19,737) to assess the health impact of husbands' out-migration for women in India. The results showed that leftbehind wives had lower self-rated health than wives of non-migrants. Part of this negative health impact was driven by the low remittances sent by the migrant husbands. For both women in nuclear families and women in extended families, the negative health impact was partially attributable to women's added responsibilities, such as animal care and managing a bank account. For women in nuclear families, the negative health effect of husbands' migration has been partially suppressed by women's increased autonomy.},

The framework posits that legitimacy has two antecedent conditions: trust- worthiness of government and procedural justice. Using African survey data, the authors model the relationship between the existence of a relatively effective, fair, and trustworthy government and beliefs that government deserves deference to its rules.

The region has seen improved macroeconomic management and substantial and sustained reductions in poverty and inequality. In this paper, we argue that social policy, including human capital and education, social insurance, and redistribution, need special attention if achievements of the last two decades are to be sustained and amplified. Starting in the mid 1990s, many governments in the region introduced a variety of programs, including noncontributory pensions and health insurance, and cash transfers targeted to the poor. Social spending in Latin America increased sharply. These policies have been widely praised, and we believe they have resulted in substantial improvements in the lives of the poor in the region. However, a more nuanced view shows some worrisome trends. Moving forward, we believe it is necessary to pay much closer attention to the quality of services, particularly in education; to the incentives generated by the interplay of some programs, particularly in the labor market; to a more balanced intertemporal distribution of benefits, particularly between young and old; and to sustainable sources of finance, particularly to the link between contributions and benefits.},

The economy is a valence issue, but it is much more than that. This article explores two other dimensions of economic voting \textendash{} position and patrimony. Investigating a 2010 British survey containing relevant measures on these three dimensions, the authors estimate their impact on vote intention, using a carefully specified system of equations. According to the evidence reported, each dimension of economic voting has its own independent effect. Moreover, together, they reveal a `compleat' economic voter, who wields considerable power over electoral choice in Britain. This new result confirms and extends recent work on American and French elections.},

The program was a poor substitute for the teacher delivered curriculum and as a result, the in-school model caused students to learn significantly less than they otherwise would have learned (-0.57 standard deviations). When implemented as a complement to the normal program in the out-of-school model, however, the program generated average gains of 0.28 standard deviations reflecting small positive (but statistically insignificant) gains by most students and large positive gains by the weakest and older students in the class (from 0.4 to 0.69 standard deviations).

We propose a reconciliation between these two perspectives, building on related work in philosophy. After laying out a taxonomy of different variants of each view, we observe that (i) although political phenomena result from underlying individual attitudes and behavior, individual-level descriptions do not always capture all explanatorily salient properties, and (ii) nonreductionistic explanations are mandated when social regularities are robust to changes in their individual-level realization. We characterize the dividing line between phenomena requiring nonreductionistic explanation and phenomena permitting individualistic explanation and give examples from the study of ethnic conflicts, social-network theory, and international-relations theory.

  abstract = {This monograph explores the politics and practices of policy-making and policy implementation with regard to elementary education in India in historical context. It addresses four main questions: What progress has there been in access to elementary education over the past 60 years? What policies for access to elementary education have been promoted? What role has political will played in the process of elementary education policy formulation? What have been the drivers and inhibitors of the implementation of reforms in elementary education in recent years? The monograph draws upon interviews conducted by the author with key actors and observers of the policy processes, alongside documentary sources. The development of ideas about basic education provision and its expansion is traced through the colonial and postindependence periods to the present; with attention to the influence of key political and philosophical traditions, including the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi and opposing views rooted in modernisation, `human capital' and technical-scientific conceptions of development. An overview of the development of access to and provision for elementary education in the post-independence period is provided and there is a detailed consideration of policy-making during the First Five Year Plan under Nehru and thereafter. Formal commitments to Universal Elementary Education in India appear in policy text and discourse early on; but are arguably not matched either with adequate resource or political will. Prior to 1976, despite the formulation of national level policies, responsibility for elementary education lay essentially with the states, presenting an obstacle to the implementation of a national policy on universal elementary education. This was removed in 1976 and ten years later India formulated what became its most important post-independence basic education policy, the 1986 National Policy on Education. The politics surrounding this policy, including the importance of high-level political will, the dynamics of centre-state relations and resistance in the implementation phase are delineated, including with reference to the Programme of Action and to Operation Blackboard. The 1990s saw the growth of both central direction in education and of international participation and support. A number of key projects are outlined to illustrate this development, including Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and its provisions for marginalised groups based on gender, caste, tribe and the extent of local deprivation. The international dimension is considered in terms of the politics of donor (particularly the World Bank) relations with authorities in Indian education and in terms of the role of the global EFA movement. The tensions between education agendas focused on expansion, quality improvement, human rights and economic development during the 1990s led ultimately to a constitutional amendment in 2002, which provided for a legal right to basic education. Nonetheless, it was 2009 before the Right to Education Bill became law. The monograph examines the slow progress of the Bill and proceeds to identify a series of key drivers and inhibitors of educational progress at the elementary stage in India over the entire period under consideration. Among the factors considered, political will is found to be an important driver and corruption, resistance by vested interests and the general condition of poverty in rural areas are among the key inhibitors.},

Collaborative contact increases cross-caste friendships and efficiency in trade, and reduces own-caste favoritism. In contrast, adversarial contact generally reduces cross-caste interaction and efficiency. League participation reduces intergroup differences, suggesting that the positive aspects of intergroup contact more than offset the negative aspects in this setting.

Finally, I show that policy awareness has enhanced citizens' trust in China's central government, but not in local governments. This asymmetry in regime support has two sources\textemdash the decentralization of education provision and biased media reporting\textemdash which induce citizens to credit the central government for good policy outcomes. Given that citizens' responses are primarily influenced by policy awareness that is promoted by the state media, this study casts doubt on the use of social policies to sustain long-term political support.},

  abstract = {Liberalization's Children explores how youth and gender have become crucial sites for a contested cultural politics of globalization in India. Popular discourses draw a contrast between ``midnight's children,'' who were rooted in post-independence Nehruvian developmentalism, and ``liberalization's children,'' who are global in outlook and unapologetically consumerist. Moral panics about beauty pageants and the celebration of St. Valentine's Day reflect ambivalence about the impact of an expanding commodity culture, especially on young women. By simply highlighting the triumph of consumerism, such discourses obscure more than they reveal. Through a careful analysis of ``consumer citizenship,'' Ritty A. Lukose argues that the breakdown of the Nehruvian vision connects with ongoing struggles over the meanings of public life and the cultural politics of belonging. Those struggles play out in the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism; reconfigurations of youthful, middle-class femininity; attempts by the middle class to alter understandings of citizenship; and assertions of new forms of masculinity by members of lower castes.Moving beyond elite figurations of globalizing Indian youth, Lukose draws on ethnographic research to examine how non-elite college students in the southern state of Kerala mediate region, nation, and globe. Kerala sits at the crossroads of development and globalization. Held up as a model of left-inspired development, it has also been transformed through an extensive and largely non-elite transnational circulation of labor, money, and commodities to the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. Focusing on fashion, romance, student politics, and education, Lukose carefully tracks how gender, caste, and class, as well as colonial and postcolonial legacies of culture and power, affect how students navigate their roles as citizens and consumers. She explores how mass-mediation and an expanding commodity culture have differentially incorporated young people into the structures and aspirational logics of globalization.},

We combine a multistage sampling design with hierarchical modeling to estimate ISAF and Taliban support at the individual, village, and district levels, permitting a more fine-grained analysis of wartime attitudes than previously possible.},

In Ghana, the government has generally attempted to strengthen the informal social welfare systems of the extended family and community through a more de- centralized social policy, whereas the government in C6te d'Ivoire has tried to replace these informal social networks with the centralized arm of the bureaucracy. The article shows how different legacies of colonial rule produce these divergent social policies in a complex and iterative process over time. While domestic insti- tutions do mediate the effects of globalization, the domestic factors highlighted in this article are not the formal political institutions cited in most studies. Rather, the analysis reveals the critical role of informal institutions, or normative frameworks, that existed under colonial rule and continue to endure in the post-colonial state. The article also contributes to current theories of institutions by showing how for- mal and informal institutions dynamically interact in the construction of the state and the African family.},

India's Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluhwalia have both emphasized that investing in infrastructure and accelerating its development are vital to growth. To achieve this aim, India's 2012-13 budget reiterated a commitment to spend 50 trillion rupees (\$920 billion) on infrastructure development during its 2012-17 frve-year plan, with roughly half this investment expected to come from the private sector. Some, however, doubt the feasibility of the government's frve-year infrastructure spending goal, particularly the ability to attract \$500 billion in private investment. While India is second only to China in the number of ongoing public-private partnerships (PPPs) and second only to Brazil in PPP investments, bottlenecks remain.

An introductory essay locates the sources of CHA's enduring influence in core characteristics that distinguish this approach, such as its attention to process and its commitment to empirically grounded, deep case-based research. Subsequent chapters explore broad research programs inspired by CHA work, new analytic tools for studying temporal processes and institutional dynamics, and recent methodological tools for analyzing sequences and for combining CHA work with other approaches. This volume is essential reading for scholars seeking to learn about the sources of CHA's enduring influence and its contemporary analytical and methodological techniques"--},

  abstract = {When do public institutions operate effectively on behalf of marginalized citizens? The Indian government has enacted a number of policies for universal primary education, and yet implementation varies dramatically across the country. Why, operating under the same national policy framework, democratic institutions and formal administrative structures, do some public agencies in India implement primary education more effectively than others? This paper analyzes the exceptional performance of the Indian hill state of Himachal Pradesh (HP) in implementing universal primary education. I develop a theory centered on bureaucratic norms, unwritten rules that guide bureaucratic behavior and operating procedures within the state and structure the relations between officials and civic actors outside the state. Using a variety of field research methods, including interviews, focus group discussions, participant-observation and village ethnography, I find that bureaucratic norms in Himachal Pradesh encourage public officials to bend official rules, adapt policies to local needs, and encourage civic participation, which leads to better implementation outcomes. The study draws on a series of sub-national comparisons and nested case studies to identify the mechanism by which bureaucratic norms produce implementation outcomes. The findings obtain after controlling for crucial variables, including geography, income, caste composition and political party system. The study of policy implementation offers new theoretical insights on how public agencies shape the quality of governance and well-being in developing democracies.},

Drawing on interviews and official documents, I demonstrate the catalytic role of committed state elites, who introduced incremental reforms over three decades. These officials operated beneath the political radar, layering small-scale initiatives on top of the mainstream school system. Following India's globalization in the 1990s, support from the World Bank gave committed officials the political opportunity to experiment with new programs in underperforming regions, which they progressively extended across the country. These incremental reforms supplied the institutional blueprint for India's universal primary education program. Along with state initiative from above, civil society mobilized from below, using the judiciary to hold the state legally responsible for policy implementation. Reforms exposed acute gaps in service delivery, propelling new civic demands for state accountability.},

Organizational processes of gender-based training and deliberation enabled fieldworkers to challenge village patriarchy and exclusion and forge programmatic ties with lower caste women. By altering rules to address the practical needs of households, fieldworkers effectively integrated disadvantaged girls into the education system. Institutional activism also engendered conflicts over rules within the bureaucracy, prompting senior officials to advocate for marginalized groups. The findings suggest that institutional commitment to activism is critical for agencies working on the front lines of reform.},

We show that the segregation of FLE students from non-FLE students increased by about 15\% in large school districts and find that charter school penetration and growth played a role in increasing socioeconomic segregation within districts. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in charter enrollment rates increases the dissimilarity index in a district by 6\% of a standard deviation. Although this impact is modest, we do find that segregation is more pervasive in the charter sector. So, continued growth of charter schools could exacerbate socioeconomic segregation.},

As a preliminary effort to remedy this shortcoming in the literature, we offer a political logic for the observed variation in the character of institutions of social policy es- tablished by nondemocratic regimes. Next, we explore recent research examining linkages between models of economic development and wel- fare regimes in developing countries. Finally, we turn to the study of the political determinants of the social policy reforms that occurred in the final decades of the twentieth century, arguing that variation in reform across policy areas has been more complex than is generally appreci- ated in the literature.To explain this variation, we develop a theory that identifies the political coalitions supporting different policy outcomes.},

A long line of thinkers has debated the nature and direction of such effects, but claims are difficult to assess empirically because market engagement is endogenous. We designed a large field experiment to evaluate the impact of financial markets, which have grown dramatically in recent decades. Participants from a national sample in England received substantial sums they could invest over a six-week period. We assigned them into several treatments designed to distinguish between different theoretical channels of influence. Results show that investment in stocks led to a more right-leaning outlook on issues such as merit and deservingness, personal responsibility and equality. Subjects also shifted to the right on policy questions. These results appear to be driven by growing familiarity with, and decreasing distrust of markets. The spread of financial markets thus has important and under-appreciated political ramifications.},

However, scholars examining schooling's political effects have struggled to reconcile education's correlation with both more liberal social attitudes and greater income. To disentangle this relationship, I exploit a major school leaving age reform in Great Britain that caused almost half the population to remain at high school for at least an additional year. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, I find that each additional year of late high school increases the probability of voting Conservative in later life by 12 percentage points. A similar relationship holds when pooling all cohorts, suggesting that high school education is a key determinant of voting behavior and that the reform could have significantly altered electoral outcomes. I provide evidence suggesting that, by increasing an individual's income, education increases support for right-wing economic policies, and ultimately the Conservative party.},

However, schooling's influence competes with early socialization forces and may be confounded by selection biases. Consequently, little is known about whether or how high school education shapes downstream political preferences and voting behavior. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design leveraging variation in U.S. state dropout laws across cohorts, I find that raising the school dropout age decreases Democratic partisan identification and voting later in life. Instrumental variables estimates suggest that an additional completed grade of high school decreases Democratic support by around 15 percentage points among students induced to remain in school by higher dropout ages. High school's effects principally operate by increasing income and support for conservative economic policies, especially at an individual's midlife earnings peak. In contrast, such schooling does not affect conservative attitudes on noneconomic issues or political engagement.},

It does so by tracking the implementation of India's am- bitious social security legislation, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (NREGA). NREGA is premised on the introduction of a vigorous transparency into a notoriously flawed state delivery system. On the basis of long-term immer- sion in the everyday world of government offices in northern India, I argue that transparent governance is, quite literally, made by documents. An ethnographic fo- cus on ``transparent-making documents'' leads me to argue that they had the ironic and entirely unintended effect of making this particular developmental law extremely difficult to implement. I demonstrate my thesis on the crisis of implementation by attending initially to the overwhelming volume and forms of labor expected from lower-level development bureaucrats to produce the transparent-making documents. Subsequently, I turn to the kinds of work these papery artifacts were doing to ar- gue that they were posing a hindrance to the regular working of the Indian state.},

Board (1954) catalyzed a nationwide effort by the federal judiciary to desegregate public schools by court order, representing a major achievement for the U.S. civil rights movement. Four decades later, courts began dismissing schools from desegregation decrees in a staggered fashion, causing their racial homogeneity to rise. I leverage this exogenous source of variation in the racial mix of schools released from court orders between 1990 and 2014 to explore two key aspects of how whites react to attending schools with students of color. First, contemporaneous survey data indicate that as schools re-segregated, white students in these schools expressed more favorable attitudes towards black and Latino students. Second, present-day voter records from six Southern states of white students in schools that re-segregated show that they are significantly more likely to identify with the more racially liberal party \textendash{} the Democrats \textendash{} today. The findings are consistent with white students experiencing resegregation as a reduction in social threat, and indicate that school desegregation efforts may have caused life-long shifts among white students toward racial and political conservatism.},

METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis of the scheme and analysis of secondary data. We estimate the lives of mothers and newborns potentially saved because of the scheme. RESULTS: More than 800 obstetricians have joined the scheme and more than 269000 poor women have delivered in private facilities in 2 years. We estimate that the percentage of institutional deliveries among poor women increased from 27\% to 48\% between April 2007 and September 2008. In addition, there are fewer reported maternal and newborn deaths among the beneficiaries compared with the number of deaths expected in the absence of the scheme. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative program shows that, at least in some areas of India, it is possible to develop a large scale partnership with the private sector to provide skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care to poor women at a relatively low cost. This is one way of addressing the human resource deficit in the public sector in rural areas of low-income countries to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. We also conclude that the skilled care thus provided can reduce maternal and neonatal mortality among the poor.},

First, schools in general affect more than just students' test scores. Second, secondary schools (including grades 9\textendash 12) make up a larger share of the charter sector. Third, school choice depends on freely available information for parents and students to make informed decisions about where to attend, including potential long-term benefits.

The treatments included instructional interventions, health interventions, and incentive-based interventions. On average, monetary grants and deworming had effects that were close to zero and statistically insignificant. Nutritional treatments, treatments that provided information to parents or students, and treatments that improved school management and supervision had small mean effect sizes (0.04-0.06) that were not always robust to controls for study moderators. The largest mean effect sizes included treatments with instructional materials (0.08); computers or instructional technology (0.15); teacher training (0.12); smaller classes, smaller learning groups within classes, or ability grouping (0.12); student and teacher performance incentives (0.10); and contract or volunteer teachers (0.10). Meta- regressions that controlled for treatment heterogeneity and other moderators suggested that the effects of materials and contract teachers, in particular, were partly accounted for by composite treatments that also included teacher training and class size reduction. A caveat is that interventions like deworming and school lunches often affected enrollment and attainment independently of learning, implying that student time is not always used productively in schools. There is insufficient data to gauge the relative cost-effectiveness of categories of interventions.},

It shows how, in principal, this can be used both to give an estimate of the overall rate of illegal migration in the population being surveyed, as well as to determine illegal migration rates for subgroups such as more or less educated households. The results suggest that there is some useful information in this method: higher rates of illegal migration in countries where illegal migration is thought to be more prevalent and households who say they have a migrant are more likely to report having an illegal migrant. Nevertheless, some of the other findings also suggest some possible inconsistencies or noise in the conclusions obtained using this method.

  abstract = {Seva Mandir had been working in this area for over two decades. In the 1970s Seva Mandir had done work to promote adult education, and agricultural extension work. Towards the end of the decade it had tried to help villagers form groups to negotiate their entitlements from the State. Alas, the expectations from group formation and awareness-raising work were not realized. The failure of the groups to influence government systems and officials led Seva Mandir in the mid `80s to focus on creating capacity among local people, and also within Seva Mandir to service some of the development needs of the people. The choice of programs to be supported was weighed in favor of cooperative efforts. Despite having created this capacity, no headway on development could be made in Nayakheda due to the nature of local politics. The nexus between the local landlord, officials, and elected village council representatives was so powerful and self - serving that they refused space to the poor to undertake development activities with the help of Seva Mandir. The lack of adequate response from the State, despite repeated efforts by the groups to claim their attention, made Seva Mandir realize that people would lose faith in themselves and the value of coming together if they did not experience some positive outcomes. With this thinking, Seva Mandir developed a major program to enable villagers to afforest their degraded private and common lands, and also developed capacity to build dams to store water, which was very scarce in the area. In 1987-88, Seva Mandir built a substantial water reservoir in Shyampura village. The village people had been promised this structure by the district magistrate in 1985 but nothing had happened. The successful completion of the dam created good will for and confidence in Seva Mandir among the people. It also greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the village group of Shyampura and their leaders who had lobbied for this project for a long time. In 1991 there was a change in forest policy by the state. For the first time in 100 years of forest policy, local communities were given the right to protect forest land and in return also to share in the benefits generated from the land. This Joint Forest Management policy gave the Shyampura community a chance to develop the watershed with the permission of the forest department. After elaborate preparations, the contract to improve 50 ha. of the watershed was signed between the forest department and an elected committee representing the community. The leaders of the group who stood to lose access to their encroached lands in the watershed were persuaded to agree to this venture with the promise that Seva Mandir would build them a lift irrigation system downstream to compensate them for the loss of their access to forest lands. The decision to convert forest land into a joint property of the village was initially not appreciated by all the villagers; for some it meant that the option to privatize the land was foreclosed. In fact people from the neighboring village of Amila immediately started to make their own encroachments when they heard about the JFM contract being signed. Through protracted efforts on the part of Seva Mandir and the Shyampura group to resolve conflicts and doubts amongst the potential stake holders, the project made headway. The prestige gained by Seva Mandir and the local group in building the dam played an important role in getting the people to agree to this project.},

I simulate policies reallocating students across schools. Race-based policies have nonlinear effects on within-school segregation and other network features such as clustering and centrality. Policies increasing diversity through reallocations based on income have less impact on racial segregation. (JEL H75, I21, I28, J15)},

Government policies can play a crucial role in this process, shaping the things publics believe and want, the ways citizens view themselves and others, and how they understand and act toward the political system. Yet, while political scientists have said a great deal about how publics influence policies, they know far less about the ways policies influence publics. In this article, we seek to clarify how policies, once enacted, are likely to affect political thought and action in the citizenry. Such effects are hard to locate within the standard framework of approaches to mass behavior, and they are generally ignored by program evaluators and policy analysts. To bridge this gap, we direct attention toward a long and vibrant, but underappreciated, line of inquiry we call the ``political tradition'' of mass behavior research. Drawing this tradition together with recent work on ``policy feedback,'' we outline a framework for thinking about how policies influence mass politics. The major types of such effects include defining membership; forging political cohesion and group divisions; building or undermining civic capacities; framing policy agendas, problems, and evaluations; and structuring, stimulating, and stalling political participation.},

This article examines program usage among citizens and probes the association of usage with program assessment and the likelihood of voting. Methods. We examine these issues using the 2005 Maxwell Poll, which uniquely asked respondents about both usage of 18 social programs as well as attitudes about such programs and rates of political involvement. Results. The data indicate that direct experience of social programs is fairly common and widespread across the population, but beneficiaries of programs differ in their assessments compared to nonbeneficiaries. Most significant, after controlling for various de- mographic factors, we find that the greater the number of universal programs citizens have used, the greater the likelihood that they vote; conversely, the greater the number of means-tested programs they have used, the lower their likelihood of voting. Conclusion. Experiences of social programs may influence voter turnout and may help explain why young and less advantaged citizens vote less than older citizens. Trends in social provision may be fostering inequality of political voice, particularly among younger generations.},

By attempting to restructure the political economy involved in taxation, higher education policy, and health care, Obama ventured into a policy terrain that presents immense obstacles to reform itself and to the public's perception of its success. Over time the submerged state has fostered the profitability of particular industries and induced them to increase their political capacity, which they have exercised in efforts to maintain the status quo.Yet the submerged state simultaneously eludes most ordinary citizens: they have little awareness of its policies or their upwardly redistributive effects, and feware cognizant of what is at stake in reform efforts. This article shows how, in each of the three policy areas, the contours and dynamics of the submerged state have shaped the possibilities for reform and the form it has taken, the politics surrounding it, and its prospects for success. While the ObamaAdministration won hard-fought legislative accomplishments in each area, political success will continue to depend on how well policy design, policy delivery and political communication reveal policy reforms to citizens, so that they better understand how reforms function and what has been achieved.},

His process-oriented analysis illuminates how power is exercised around the world, and how and when patterns of power change. Despite the triumph of the concept of state in social science literature, actual states have demonstrated less coherence than their theoretical counter- parts, and, despite their apparent resources, have had great difficulty in trans- forming public policies into successful social change. The state-in-society approach demonstrates both that states are fragmented and that they face a multitude of social organizations \textendash{} families, clans, multinational corporations, domestic businesses, tribes, political parties, and patron-client dyads \textendash{} that maintain and vie for the power to set the rules guiding people's behavior. These ongoing and overlapping struggles ally parts of the state with groups in society against other such coalitions. In the process, they determine how societies and states create and maintain distinct ways of structuring day-to-day life, including the nature of the rules that govern people's behavior, whom they benefit and whom they disadvantage, which sorts of elements unite people and which divide them, and what shared meanings people hold about their rela- tions with others and their place in the world.},

  abstract = {The debate over the effectiveness of foreign aid has raged on despite a paucity of information about recipients' actual views of aid. We address this deficiency with results from a national survey and field experiment on roughly 3,600 Ugandan citizens that includes several behavioral outcomes. We argue that citizens may support foreign aid because it offers a way out of the voter's dilemma (Lyne 2007, 2008) where clientelistic networks compel voters to take particularistic payoffs in lieu of public goods. Citizens may perceive foreign aid as relatively less politicized and less prone to corruption compared to government programs. They may also favor multilateral donors over bilateral donors for the same reason: they may perceive multilateral aid as less politicized and more transparent than bilateral aid. In the survey and experiment, we find that foreign aid is viewed very positively among recipients and that Ugandans favor aid donors consistently over the (quite popular) national government. In a randomized field experiment, we also find that citizens are significantly more willing to tell their local representatives that they support randomly assigned foreign aid projects, sign a petition, or send a text message in favor of the aid relative to government programs. Subjects familiar with multilateral donors were significantly more likely to sign a petition indicating their support compared to bilateral aid and government programs. Thus, our evidence indicates that citizens perceive aid generally, and multilateral aid in particular, as more transparent and less prone to politicization. The findings suggest that recipients view foreign aid \textendash{} particularly from multilateral donors \textendash{} as relatively effective and are willing to undertake costly action to support it, especially compared to the most likely alternative of government programs.},

Since the publication of Weiner's book, however, governmental support for Indian education has improved dramatically.  In  this  paper,  I  examine  what  influences  national-level  government  support  for  social development  in  the  developing  world.  I  do  so  by  examining  why  Indian  national-level government officials have shown a serious commitment to mass education reform when they have historically refused to do so. More than rising incomes, ethnic considerations, or pressures from domestic business, I find evidence that international factors \textendash{} such as foreign aid and the demands from international institutions such as the World Bank \textendash{} have played a critical role in bringing education to the forefront of Indian politics.},

  abstract = {This article makes the case for the systematic registration of political studies. By proposing a research design before an outcome variable is observed, a researcher commits him- or herself to a theoretically motivated method for studying the object of interest. Further, study registration prompts peers of the discipline to evaluate a study's quality on its own merits, reducing norms to accept significant results and reject null findings. To advance this idea, the Political Science Registered Studies Dataverse (http:// dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/registration) has been created, in which scholars may create a permanent record of a research design before completing a study. This article also illustrates the method of registration through a study of the impact of the immigration issue in the 2010 election for the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to the election, a design for this study was posted on the Society for Political Methodology website (http://polmeth.wustl.edu/mediaDetail.php?docId{$\frac{1}{4}$}1258). After the votes were counted, the study was completed in accord with the design. The treatment effect in this theoretically specified design was indiscernible, but a specification search could yield a significant result. Hence, this article illustrates the argument for study registration through a case in which the result could easily be manipulated.},

I study a dynamic model of risk sharing with limited commitment frictions and endogenous temporary migration. First, I characterize the model. I demonstrate theoretically how migration may decrease risk sharing. I decompose the welfare effect of migration into changes in income and the endogenous structure of insurance. I then show how risk sharing alters the returns to migration. Second, I structurally estimate the model us- ing the new (2001-2004) ICRISAT panel from rural India. The estimation yields: (1) risk sharing reduces migration by 55\%; (2) migration reduces risk sharing by 38\%; (3) contrasting endogenous to exogenous risk sharing, the consumption-equivalent gain from migration is 12\% lower. Third, I introduce a rural employment scheme. The policy reduces migration and decreases risk sharing. The welfare gain of the policy is 20-40\% lower after household risk sharing and migration responses are considered.},

This has been a very controversial policy, and there is limited evidence about the effectiveness of such contract teachers. We present experimental evidence from a program that provided an extra contract teacher to 100 randomly-chosen government-run rural primary schools in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. At the end of two years, students in schools with an extra contract teacher performed significantly better than those in comparison schools by 0.15 and 0.13 standard deviations, in math and language tests respectively. While all students gain from the program, the extra contract teacher was particularly beneficial for students in their first year of school and students in remote schools. Contract teachers were significantly less likely to be absent from school than civil-service teachers (16\% vs. 27\%). We also find using four different non-experimental estimation procedures that contract teachers are no less effective in improving student learning than regular civil-service teachers who are more qualified, better trained, and paid five times higher salaries.},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {India has demonstrated considerable progress in the past decade on improving primary school access, infrastructure, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher salaries, and student enrollment. Nevertheless, student learning levels and trajectories are disturbingly low. The past decade has also seen a number of high-quality empirical studies on the causes and correlates of better learning outcomes based on large samples of data and careful attention paid to identification of causal relationships. The findings from this research are however, not being reflected in the current policy priorities of the Government of India. This paper seeks to bridge the gap by summarizing the research, making policy recommendations based on this research, and suggesting an implementation roadmap for the 12th Plan. The main findings reported in this paper are that there is very little evidence to support the notion that improving school inputs in a `business as usual' manner will improve learning outcomes. On the other hand, innovations in pedagogy (especially supplemental remedial instruction targeted to the level of learning of children) and governance (focused on teacher performance measurement and management) have shown large positive impacts on student learning. The research over the past decade suggests that increasing inputs to primary education in a `business as usual' way are unlikely to improve student learning in a meaningful way unless accompanied by significant changes in pedagogy and/or improvements in school governance.},

Using a new nationally-representative panel dataset of schools across 1297 villages in India, this paper shows that the large investments over the past decade have led to substantial improvements in input-based measures of school quality, but only a modest reduction in inefficiency as measured by teacher absence. In the data, 23.6 percent of teachers were absent during unannounced visits with an associated fiscal cost of \$1.5 billion/year. There are two robust correlations in the nationally-representative panel data that corroborate findings from smaller-scale experiments. First, reductions in student-teacher ratios are correlated with increased teacher absence. Second, increases in the frequency of school monitoring are strongly correlated with lower teacher absence. Simulations using these results suggest that investing in better governance by increasing the frequency of monitoring could be over ten times more cost effective at increasing teacher-student contact time (net of teacher absence) than hiring more teachers. Thus, at current margins, policies that decrease the inefficiency of public spending in India are likely to yield substantially higher returns than those that augment inputs.},

Although the NSS does not sample every district in the country the sample sizes are reasonably large at the level of the NSS region. This opens up the possibility of using these estimates of consumption and poverty in conjunction with the census.

More specifically, the project aims to (UNRISD, 2005): \textbullet{} Assess the contribution to contemporary approaches to poverty reduction, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs); \textbullet{} Identify key institutional, policy and political issues that are not being addressed in current poverty reduction strategies; and, \textbullet{} Examine the contradictions, complementarities and synergies between different components of ``policy regimes'', including social, labour market and macroeconomic policies, and political and regulatory institutions. The project seeks to achieve the aims following the approach of ``policy regimes''. In other words, seeking to understand how different policy regimes have influenced the outcome of poverty reduction. The underlying assumption of such an approach is that poverty reduction is not simply a positive function of economic growth; macro policy environment and social policies also have significant bearing on poverty reduction. The project seeks to illustrate the value of such an approach by detailed case studies of selected countries. The countries selected are expected to illustrate how poverty reduction has been achieved under diverse economic conditions and social policy regimes, to debate the viewpoint that growth alone may explain poverty reduction, and to propose that a variety of policy regimes and institutional conditions can yield the desirable outcome. The approach implicit in all the studies in this volume is broadly social democratic, meaning, where authors perceive the advantages of selective yet decisive state intervention in securing the social development goals, and poverty reduction.},

  address = {{Sussex}},
  abstract = {Publicly provided education systems are increasingly being seen as unable to address the specific educational needs of poor and marginalized groups. The emphasis on pluralism in educational provision and alternative schooling systems for such groups hence assumes significance. This paper focuses on the education of the poor in the city of Calcutta, capital of the state of West Bengal in India. It dwells on initiatives that are underway to bring all children to primary schools both in state funded regular schools as well as in alternative schools that are being run by non-government organisations. The paper situates these initiatives in the larger context of the state of primary schooling in the city and the perceptions of educational deprivation among policy-makers, teachers and administrators. It points to the fact that primary schools are inadequate in terms of availability and offer education of relatively poor quality. However educational deprivation is seen by school providers to result largely from poverty, particularly child labour and the absence of home and community environments that are conducive to learning. This has provided the rationale for an alternative schooling system to address the specific educational needs of children who are not in regular schools. The paper acknowledges that poverty is an important constraint in the education of the children of Calcutta's poor. However it stresses that an emphasis primarily on the linkages between poverty, child labour and non enrolment in school fails to address the magnitude of educational deprivation that results from the institutional context of schooling provided to the poor. While the alternative schooling system may increase educational opportunities for poor children it is unlikely to provide education of quality. On the other hand it is likely to result in a further stratification of an already iniquitous schooling system. iii},

What we are witnessing is the construction of narratives of `good education' for the poor in extremely minimalistic terms, validated through `research' and disseminated by powerful networks. The attempt is to evolve globally scalable models that will deliver `high quality' education at the lowest of costs, yet ensuring profits. In this paper, I map some of these trends highlighting the manner in which private actors are attempting to change education policy in India by drawing upon neo-liberal discourses and constructing new narratives, networks and practices around schooling.

I show that in the subsequent decades, publicly funded schooling was narrow and extremely exclusive as a result of the strong opposition of dominant castes to the education of the Dalits (`Untouchable' castes) as well as ambivalences and compromises of the colonial state to equality in education. I argue that in the efforts towards shaping of a more inclusive and `equitable' public education, the struggles of the most excluded and stigmatised castes, the Untouchables, were crucial and have hitherto received little attention. Initiatives from within the community as well as the role of radical social reformers (I refer to Phule), Dalit activists and leaders such as Ambedkar in political and social spaces in relation to education also deserve far more serious study and acknowledgement. The neglect of the Untouchable castes in histories of education has resulted in failure to recognise their extraordinary efforts to spread education within their communities and significant contestations from below as well as in shaping discourses and practices around the `public' in schooling. It also reminds us that as we defend the public in education today, we must understand the politics around it.},

The real failure in both these periods was India's inability to transform this growth into well-being for all its people.

In addition, the explicit modeling of schools' choice of price and quality allows for the analysis of how the policy changed the nature of competition among schools. The model estimates imply that the observed policy effect is due mostly to the increase in the quality of schools in poor neighborhoods and not to a resorting of students to better schools or the entry of new higher-quality schools. The intro- duction of targeted vouchers is shown to have effectively raised competition in poor neighborhoods, pushing schools to improve their academic quality. \textdagger},

Our identification comes from the comparison between biological sisters in 67 developing countries across the globe. Quantita\- tively, a one-year increase in maternal education reduces the preferred number of sons over daughters by 0.17 percentage points. Our heterogeneity analysis further shows that the beneficial effects of maternal education are much larger for the rural and poor population.

But when fiscal space is constrained, the incumbent government's ability to provide state resources is drastically reduced. Citizens are therefore less likely to reward the party at the polls and are available to opposition politicians and alternative appeals. Vote- switching ensues, and the incumbent government is voted out of the office. The authors test this argument and others in the existing literature on electoral returns from state assembly elections across 15 major Indian states from 1967 to 2004. The results support the argument that fiscal space influences electoral volatility.},

Specifically, governments use public employment\textemdash and particularly employment in civil services and administration\textemdash to foster domestic stability alongside market expansion. However, such jobs are targeted to politically salient groups, not poorer groups that might also face increased economic uncertainty postopenness. In turn, public employment shores up public support for openness. The authors' findings suggest that free traders have reasons both to celebrate and to bemoan this LDC embedded liberalism compact. On the positive side, LDC governments are working hard to maintain political support for free trade; on the other hand, the compromise of protecting privileged groups at the expense of others in society raises questions about the long-term sustainability of their strategy.},

  abstract = {How does political favoritism impact local economic growth? Using a repeated census of Indian firms that we constructed, and a regression discontinuity design built around close elections from 1990-2005, we show that locations represented by politi- cians affiliated with the state-level ruling coalition generate 1.6 percentage points more private sector jobs per year than constituencies represented by politicians not in the governing coalition. Consistent with this, stock prices of firms show cumulative abnor- mal returns in the month following the election of a coalition candidate relative to a non-coalition candidate in the constituency where the company is headquartered. De- tailed data on location and industrial classification of firms allow us to investigate the mechanism for this effect. We find the effect is driven entirely by private sector firms, with no effect on employment in state-owned firms. Further, we identify no effect on public infrastructure. Finally, we use international survey data to classify industries based on their dependence on bureaucratic inputs, such as licenses and permits. We find the effect of political alignment is largest in industries that depend most on gov- ernment officials. This suggests that politicians are able to dynamically control the restrictiveness of regulation, and may do so for political gain},

Using a new primary data set on public ownership that contains detailed information on privatization in 20 countries between 1980 and 2007, we test these claims empirically in relation to state ownership. We pay special attention to the question of whether changes in the international political economy, notably globalization and different aspects of European integration, condition partisan politics. Our empirical findings suggest that political parties have continued to significantly shape national privatization trajectories in line with the classic partisan hypothesis. While partisan differences are somewhat reduced by the liberalizing and market-building efforts of the European Union, globalization does not condition partisan effects. Moreover, the run-up to the European Monetary Union even seems to have reinforced partisan differences.},

We find that individuals in particularly affected counties are more likely to decrease their support for organized labor and the federal government.

Despite growing literature on the difficulties of attaining MDGs, there is hardly any attempt to assess the role of private sector in this respect. Using India as an important case in point, we intend to bridge this gap of the literature. Results using a unique district-level panel data-set from 17 major states of India for the period 1992-2002 that we compile highlight a significant positive impact of private school growth on literacy while its effect on gender gap in literacy remains rather limited in our sample. Compared to 15-19 year olds, private school effect of literacy is stronger among 10-14 year old children. Interesting variations across the regions and also among the marginalised ethnic groups are noted. The paper offers explanations for the findings.},

The experiments were embedded in a public awareness campaign conducted with 1,863 citizens in Indonesia. The results\textemdash from an original survey and postcard campaign\textemdash indicate that taxation increases monitoring and anti-incumbent political action. Yet, when given spending information, citizens in a windfall context care just as much about misused revenue as taxpayers. The findings have important implications for understanding not only how revenue affects citizen political behavior but also how people acquire and process information on government spending.},

No intervention took place in control villages. At baseline there are no significant differences in school outcomes. This paper reports on the first follow up survey that took place two to four months after the intervention. We find that providing information through a structured campaign to communities had a positive impact in all three states. However, there are differences across states in where the impact occurs. The most notable impacts occurred on teacher effort, while impacts on learning were more modest. Some improvements also occurred in the delivery of benefits entitled to students (stipend, uniform and mid-day meal) and in process variables such as community participation in each of the three states. Future research needs to examine whether there is a systematic increase in learning when the impact is measured over a longer time period and whether a campaign sustained over longer duration generates greater impact on school outcomes.},

  abstract = {Presidential elections in Korea in the eighties and nineties provide an opportunity to examine the role of political patronage in a newly formed democracy. We examine whether the bureaucratic reshuffling which ac- companies presidential changes depends on the political connections of bureaucrats and whether bureaucratic reassignment is associated with changes in administrative performance. We use data on all public prose- cutors in Korea between 1992-2000 and find that sharing birth and school environments with the incumbent president roughly doubled the odds of being assigned to a range of influential positions within the Public Prose- cutor's Office. In the last of the three presidential regimes we consider, we also find that branch offices with high fractions of connected prosecutors performed poorly relative to other branches. Observations over multiple years allow us to control for unobservable characteristics of prosecutors and offices while estimating these effects of political patronage.},

Yet the plausibility of functional accounts depends upon either a set of favorable conditions at the design stage or the presence of environments conducive to learning or competition.

Using a regres- sion discontinuity approach which takes advantage of the design of a recent Romanian government program that distributed coupons worth 200 Euros to poor families towards the purchase of a com- puter, we find that program beneficiaries were significantly more likely to support the parties of the incumbent governing coalition. These effects occurred both through higher political mobilization and through party-switching. The article also analyzes the drivers of such political gains and we find that program beneficiaries did not trust either the central government or the governing parties any more than the control group. Instead, it appears that local governments reaped the bene- fits of increased trust, and the political support for incumbent parties occurred mostly in towns where the local government was controlled by one of the parties of the national ruling coalition.},

In much of the developing world, however, local public goods are not just provided by the state, but are rather characterized by hybrid goods provision\textemdash that is, the simultaneous operation of state and non-state service providers, often catering to the same consumers. This means that researchers must exert great care when choosing measures of service reach and quality, and when specifying causal mechanisms. This paper offers a descriptive typology of hybrid local public goods provision designed to help analysts of local public goods provision identify the subsets of country or subnational cases for which particular theoretical arguments best apply, as well as choose outcome measures that best reflect key quantities of interest. The typology emphasizes two dimensions: the type of state involvement (direct versus indirect provision), and the extent of informal or small-scale service provision. We illustrate the utility of this framework through an analysis of different ``hybrid regimes'' for water and sanitation and mass transit in the developing world.},

This relationship is robust to (i) different ways of defining right-wing, (ii) a variety of estimation methods, and (iii) methods that condition on the person previously having voted left. It is strongest for males. Our findings are consistent with the view that voting is driven partly by human self-interest. Money apparently makes people more right-wing. Keywords:},

The mean quality score was 52\%, with large differences across regions, states and districts. Quality of care was the worst and the variation greatest in states designated by the government as low performing. Good management practices in a facility were highly correlated with better quality of care. The majority of primary health facilities in India fall far short of government minimum standards, in part explaining why most people in rural areas use private providers for outpatient care.

In Latin America, social policies have historically exhibited large gaps in coverage and high levels of inequality in benefit size. Since the late 1990s, countries in this region have begun to grapple with these challenges, enacting a series of reforms to healthcare, social assistance, and education policy. While some of these initiatives have moved in a universal direction, others have maintained existing segmentation or moved in a regressive direction. Welfare and Party Politics in Latin America explores this variation in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Venezuela, finding that the design of previous policies, the intensity of electoral competition, and the character of political parties all influence the nature of contemporary social policy reform in Latin America.},

  abstract = {In India there persists a striking gender gap in political participation and representation, despite several decades of targeted policy interventions. Seminal theories of women's political participation fail to explain the political gender gap, and how it is reduced, in settings of restrictive, gender-biased social norms. I first propose an alternative model of local politics in the status quo, which explains women's non-participation as a function of ``family-centered clientelism." I then theoretically propose one potential solution forward \textendash{} women's access to non-political networks of other women -- which I argue can lead to a shift in the political equilibrium under certain conditions where both men and women are active political participants. I test this potential mechanism for women's political empowerment using a geographic regression discontinuity design with pair-matched villages to identify the impact of a program aimed at mobilizing women into small collectives. Original survey data of 5,371 women and 2,399 men in 376 villages in rural Madhya Pradesh demonstrates that women who participated in this network intervention were significantly more active in local politics. Women's attendance at local public meetings is estimated to double and women were 11\textbackslash\% more likely to make a claim on the Sarpanch (local leader). I argue and empirically demonstrate that this network intervention has this effect by (1) incentivizing network, political mobilization, (2) transferring political information and skills, and (3) developing women's civic skills and confidence. I confirm with qualitative interview data. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I show no effect of the network intervention on income and further show income to be uncorrelated with political participation. These findings have implications for larger studies of political participation and importantly help to fill the gap in our understanding of gendered political behavior.},

  abstract = {Three forces are coming together to bring the issue of the relationship between local government and education onto the agenda. First, in the early 1990s India embarked on a process of creating autonomous units of local government that were elected and which were to be given substantial responsibilities. These bodies, the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) have three tiers generally called the district, block, and Gram Panchayat. There are now over three million people in India who are elected representatives of the PRI bodies. But the actual progress in devolving substantial autonomy and real responsibility to these units of government has seen very mixed progress across the states. Second, there has been increasing attention to the expansion of education. A government launched scheme, Sarva Shiksa Abhiyan (SSA) has attracted increased resources and attention to the elementary sector. Enrollments in primary school have increased substantially. But recent research (which follows up on the pioneering PROBE report) on absenteeism, learning achievement, and the expansion of private schooling suggests that all is not entirely well with basic education in India. People are interested in ways to tackle the ``next generation'' issues. Third, the World Development Report on Service Delivery has focused in on the key role of relationships of accountability in providing for effective service delivery. This report has provided a framework for the analysis of accountability in publicly provided services, including how a shift from state level line agency to locally elected bodies might, if well designed, improve accountabilities. This paper brings these three strands together. Its aim is not to advocate for decentralization, which is far from panacea, but rather to tackle the question ``If a state of India has chosen to devolve real responsibility for basic education to PRI bodies what is the most desirable arrangement of the functions, fund flows, and functionaries so that this devolution leads to improved learning achievement?'' In order to do so, this paper uses a combination of analytical approach, reasoning from first principles of public finance and from first principles of accountability, and existing empirical research to propose a way forward for PRIs in tackling the responsibility for basic education.},

  abstract = {Economists appear to have a good case for support to non- governmental alternatives as suppliers of schooling. However, unlike other policy domains, freer international trade or privatization, economists have been remarkably unsuccessful in promoting the adoption of this idea. We develop a simple general positive model of why governments typically produce schooling which introduces the key notion of the lack of verifiability of socialization and instruction of beliefs, which makes third party contracting for socialization problematic. We use the model to explain variations around the world in levels of private schooling. We also predict the circumstances in which efforts to promote the different alternatives to government production \textendash like charter, voucher, and scholarship- are likely to be successful.

  abstract = {Does the government control of school systems facilitate equality in school quality? There is a trade-off. On the one hand, government direct control of schools, typically through a large scale hierarchical organization, could produce equalization across schools, providing for uniformity in inputs, standards, teacher qualifications that localized, individually managed, schools could not achieve. But there is a tendency for large scale formal bureaucracies to ``see'' less and less of localized reality and hence to manage on the basis of a few simple, objective, and easily administratively verified, characteristics (e.g. resources per student, teacher formal qualifications). Whether centralized or localized control produces more equality therefore depends not only on what ``could'' happen in principle but what does happen in practice. When government implementation capacity is weak, centralized control could lead to only the illusion of equality: in which central control of education with weak internal or external accountability actually allows for much greater inequalities across schools than entirely ``uncontrolled'' local schools. Data from Pakistan, using results from the LEAPS study, and from two states of India show much larger variance in school quality (adjusted for student characteristics) among the government schools\textemdash because of long left tail very poor public schools which continue in operation. We use the PISA data to estimate school specific learning achievement (in mathematics, science, and reading) net of student individual and school average background characteristics and compare public and private schools for 34 countries. On average for these countries there is exactly as much learning outcome equality within the private schools as within the public schools. But while the same on average in some countries, such as Denmark, there was much more equality within the public sector while in others, such as Mexico, there was much more inequality among the public schools. Among the 18 non-OECD participating PISA countries the standard deviation across schools in adjusted quality was, on average, 36 percent higher in government than in private schools. In many cases with weak states the proximate cause of high inequality again was that the public sector had a long left tail of extremely poorly performing schools. Relying on blinded weak states for top-down control of educational systems can be lose-lose relative to localized systems relying on bottom-up control\textemdash producing worse average performance and higher inequality. 1},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Many countries remain stuck in conditions of low productivity that many call ``poverty traps.'' Economic growth is only one aspect of development; another key dimension of development is the expansion of the administrative capability of the state, the capability of governments to affect the course of events by implementing policies and programs. We use a variety of empirical indicators of administrative capability to show that many countries remain in ``state capability traps'' in which the implementation capability of the state is both severely limited and improving (if at all) only very slowly. At their current pace of progress countries like Haiti or Afghanistan or Liberia would take hundreds (if not thousands) of years to reach the capability of a country like Singapore and decades to reach even a moderate capability country like India. We explore how this can be so. That is, we do not attempt to explain why countries remain in capability traps; this would require a historical, political and social analysis uniquely applied to each country. Rather, we focus on how countries manage to engage in the domestic and international logics of ``development'' and yet consistently fail to acquire capability. What are the techniques of failure? Two stand out. First, `big development' encourages progress through importing standard responses to predetermined problems. This encourages isomorphic mimicry as a technique of failure: the adoption of the forms of other functional states and organizations which camouflages a persistent lack of function. Second, an inadequate theory of developmental change reinforces a fundamental mismatch between expectations and the actual capacity of prevailing administrative systems to implement even the most routine administrative tasks. This leads to premature load bearing, in which wishful thinking about the pace of progress and unrealistic expectations about the level and rate of improvement of capability lead to stresses and demands on systems that cause capability to weaken (if not collapse). We conclude with some suggestive directions for sabotaging these techniques of failure.},

  year = {2014},
  abstract = {The incredibly low levels of learning and the generally dysfunctional public sector schooling systems in many (though not all) developing countries are the result of a capability trap (Pritchett et al. 2010). Two phenomena reinforce persistent failure of schooling systems to produce adequate learning outcomes. One is the mismatch between system design\textemdash the allocation of activities across organizations and mechanisms of accountability\textemdash and the insights of the `new institutional economics' from principal agent models and contract theory. In particular, many education systems attempt to manage teaching and learning as a `thin' or `logistical' activity that can be managed with top-down control and an emphasis on compliance. The reality is that teaching is a `thick' or `implementation intensive' activity that performs better when teachers and operators of schools are given performance standards, have multiple in-depth accountability channels, and are given greater autonomy. The second phenomena that facilitates persistent failure is global isomorphism on enrollment and inputs (Meyer et al. 1977; Boli et al. 1985; Meyer et al. 1997). That is, the field (in the sense of Bourdieu 1993) of global education has produced a near exclusive emphasis on enrollments and duration in school, adequacy of physical inputs, and formal qualifications that allowed, perhaps encouraged, national systems to ignore completely performance on child-learning (of any type, measured in any way). I conclude with a comparison in India of the national governments recent efforts in basic education which have been almost exclusively isomorphic.},

  abstract = {In the recent past the impact of structural adjustment in the Indian health care sector has been felt in the reduction in central grants to States for public health and disease control programmes. This falling share of central grants has had a more pronounced impact on the poorer states, which have found it more difficult to raise local resources to compensate for this loss of revenue. With the continued pace of reforms, the likelihood of increasing State expenditure on the health care sector is limited in the future. As a result, a number of notable trends are appearing in the Indian health care sector. These include an increasing investment by non-resident Indians (NRIs) in the hospital industry, leading to a spurt in corporatization in the States of their original domicile and an increasing participation by multinational companies in diagnostics aiming to capture the potential of the Indian health insurance market. The policy responses to these private initiatives are reflected in measures comprising strategies to attract private sector participation and management inputs into primary health care centres (PHCs), privatization or semi-privatization of public health facilities such as non-clinical services in public hospitals, innovating ways to finance public health facilities through nonbudgetary measures, and tax incentives by the State governments to encourage private sector investment in the health sector. Bearing in mind the vital importance of such market forces and policy responses in shaping the future health care scenario in India, this paper examines in detail both of these aspects and their implications for the Indian health care sector. The analysis indicates that despite the promising newly emerging atmosphere, there are limits to market forces; appropriate refinement in the role of government should be attempted to avoid undesirable consequences of rising costs, increasing inequity and consumer exploitation. This may require opening the health insurance market to multinational companies, the proper channelling of tax incentives to set up medical institutions in backward areas, and reinforcing appropriate regulatory mechanisms.},

This article argues that the distinctive design of leave policy in the United States is explained by its origins in contestation over the civil rights policy regime that emerged in the 1960s. In the early 1970s, women's movement advocates creatively and strategically formulated demands for maternity leave provision that fit an interpretation of this new policy regime's antidiscrimination logic. Because of this decision to advance an antidiscrimination claim, advocates became committed to pursuing a leave guarantee on gender-neutral grounds, which in turn enabled the broad-coverage leave design. This case study suggests that scholars of social policy and American political development should pay greater attention to the impact of civil rights on social policy. This article also contributes to the study of policy development by providing an example of how political actors cross boundaries between policy domains during the policy making process and by presenting a reconceptualization of ``policy regimes.''},

These effects are driven by personal interactions between rich and poor students. In contrast, I find mixed but overall modest impacts on rich students' academic achievement.},

Drawing on the comparative politics literature and using electoral data from 1977 to 2005, this paper analyses the performance of ruling parties in national and state elections in India. The findings are that incumbent members of Parliament from national ruling parties and legislative assembly members from state ruling parties are less likely to win than incumbents from the opposition when they come up for re-election. The paper also measures the ``honeymoon period'' effect, namely, the advantage that candidates from the state ruling party enjoy in national elections that are held early in the state government's term and candidates from the national ruling party enjoy in state elections. India's patronage-based democratic system and federal structure creates incentives for voters to favour the same party for national and state office and coordinate their votes. However, the honeymoon period is short-lived, and the positive effect turns into a negative penalty within two years of a party's term in office.},

One would expect this to be the case if discrimina- tion and/or role model effects persist in the classroom. School and individual fixed effects methodology are used. In the pupil fixed effects model, across subject variation is used to test whether having a teacher whose gender, caste and religion are the same as that of the student improves student test scores. We find statistically significant positive effects of matching student and teacher characteristics. We find that a student's achievement in a sub- ject in which the teacher shares the same gender, caste and religion as the child is, on average, nearly a quarter of a SD higher than the same child's achievement in a subject taught by a teacher who does not share the child's gender, caste or religion.

One of the large public programs was a capitation grant to cover schools' nonwage expenditures. Using panel data from a unique survey of primary schools, we assess the extent to which the grant actually reached the intended end-user (schools). The survey data reveal that during 1991\textendash 1995, the schools, on average, received only 13 percent of the grants. Most schools received nothing. The bulk of the school grant was captured by local officials (and politicians). The data also reveal considerable variation in grants received across schools, suggesting that rather than being passive recipients of flows from the government, schools use their bargaining power to secure greater shares of funding. We find that schools in better-off communities managed to claim a higher share of their entitlements. As a result, actual education spending, in contrast to budget allocations, is regressive. Similar surveys in other African countries confirm that Uganda is not a special case.},

These developments are part of marketmaking changes in higher education as the sector is opened to new actors, logics, and innovative services, aimed at `the global south'. Yet making a higher education market that brings in new investors, providers, and consumers from within and across the global north and south is a complex process that requires imagining and materialising through new social devices, norms, and institutions so that the higher education sector works like a capitalist market based on competition, credit, commodification, and creativity. The paper examines these processes through three entry points: recruiters of international students; for-profit providers of HE; and financial agents providing new forms of credit. We argue that these developments both play off, and reinforce, older and newer asymmetries of power between individuals, social groups, and nations, within and between the global north and south, creating an even greater learning divide.},

This Article examines the development of India's basic structure doctrine and the Court's broad right to life jurisprudence to explore how the Court has enlarged its role. It argues that the Court justified these two doctrines with not only a wide reading of the Indian Constitution, but also an appeal to broad, almost metaphysical, principles of ``civilization'' or good governance. The Article finishes by examining parallel interventions in other parts of the world, which suggest India's experience is part of, and helps explain the larger global phenomenon of, the rise of rule through good governance principles via courts.},

As such, aspects of health systems in these countries may be associated with public trust in government. Greater trust in government may in turn improve governance and government effectiveness. We identify health system and non \textendash{} health system factors hypothesized to be associated with trust in government and fit several multilevel regression models to cross- national data from 51,300 respondents in thirty- eight low- and middle- income countries partici- pating in the World Health Surveys. We find that health system performance factors are associated with trust in government while controlling for a range of non \textendash{} health system covariates. Taken together, higher technical quality of health services, more responsive service delivery, fair treatment, better health outcomes, and financial risk protection accounted for a 13 percentage point increase in the probability of having trust in government. Health system performance and good governance may be more inter- related than previously thought. This finding is particularly important for low- income and fragile states, where health systems and governments tend to be weakest. Future research efforts should focus on determining the causal mechanisms that underlie the observed associations between health system performance and trust in government.},

Women have also made significant strides in terms of socioeconomic status and political engagement. What explains the progress that American women have made since the 1960s? While many point to the feminist movement as the critical turning point, this book makes the case that women's movement toward first class citizenship has been shaped not only by important societal changes, but also by the actions of lawmakers who used a combination of redistributive and regulatory higher education policies to enhance women's incorporation into their roles as American citizens. Examining the development and impact of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, this book argues that higher education policies represent a crucial-though largely overlooked-factor shaping the progress that women have made. By significantly expanding women's access to college, they helped to pave the way for women to surpass men as the recipients of bachelor's degrees, while also empowering them to become more economically independent, socially integrated, politically engaged members of the American citizenry. In addition to helping to bring into greater focus our understanding of how Southern Democrats shaped U.S. social policy development during the mid-twentieth century, this analysis recognizes federal higher education policy as an indispensible component of the American welfare state.},

  abstract = {Multivariate matching permits the construction of matched pairs or matched sets that balance large numbers of observed covariates. Unlike model-based adjustments, in matching a patient remains intact as a single patient, and may be scrutinized as an individual and thickly described. A thick description entails a detailed, perhaps narrative, account of a patient's care, for instance, the account one might find in the 'Case Reports from the Massachusetts General Hospital' as published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While discussing certain principles of thick description, we illustrate using data from the pilot for a case-control study of the causes of death following surgery. Matching is based on billing data from Medicare, and the medical charts of matched pairs are then abstracted. In the pilot, we matched cases and controls in one hospital, located and scrutinized their medical charts. As a consequence, we corrected our misinterpretations of aspects of Medicare billing data, thereby improving the matching for the full study. Also, looking at charts suggested topics for investigation and helped us understand the types of information we might reliably find in charts, and this reshaped our plans for chart abstraction. Our central claim is that, unlike other methods of adjustment, matching facilitates thick description of a handful of cases, and such scrutiny of cases benefits statistical studies at several stages. Thick description of a few matched cases is used repeatedly to improve the matching and to design further data collection for the matched sample. Thick description aids matching by providing close examination of what the matching has actually accomplished, an examination that uses much more information than is available for use in matching. Matching aids thick description by placing side by side two patients who are fairly comparable, so that a thick description of them may usefully be performed.},

Yet there are good reasons to believe that taxation led to representation in the past: representative government first came about in early modern Europe when monarchs were compelled to relinquish some of their authority to parliamentary institutions, in exchange for the ability to raise new taxes; similarly, the war for independence in the United States began as a rebellion against British taxes. Some scholars argue that a comparable process is occurring today: the need to raise taxes forces authoritarian governments to democratize. These claims have never been carefully tested. In this article, the `taxation leads to representation' argument is explored and tested using pooled time-series cross-national data from 113 countries between 1971 and 1997.Oneversion of the argument appears to be valid, while another does not. These findings are important both for scholars who wish to understand the causes of democracy, and for policy makers who wish to promote it.},

Based on analyses of political theory, we propose a more coherent and specific definition of QoG: the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority. We relate the idea of impartiality to a series of criticisms stem- ming from the fields of public administration, public choice, multicultur- alism, and feminism. To place the theory of impartiality in a larger context, we then contrast its scope and meaning with that of a threefold set of competing concepts of quality of government: democracy, the rule of law, and efficiency/effectiveness},

This paper engages these questions. In part 1, I argue that three slow-burning processes since the 1980s, distinct yet related, catalyzed India's new rights Copyright (c) Pacific Affairs. All rights reserved. agenda: high socio-legal activism, rapid uneven development and the expanding popular foundations of its federal parliamentary democracy. Significantly, all three processes exposed the growing nexus between political corruption and socioeconomic inequality. Equally, however, each raised popular expectations for greater social justice that were only partly met. Part 2 of the paper evaluates India's new rights agenda. The promise of these new laws is threefold: they breach the traditional division of civil, political and socioeconomic rights, devise innovative governance mechanisms that enable citizens to see the state and provide fresh incentives for new political coalitions to emerge across state and society. Several risks exist, however. Official political resistance from above and below, the limited capacities of judicial actors, state bureaucracies and social forces and the relatively narrow base of many of these new movements endanger the potential of these reforms. The paper concludes by considering several imperatives that India's evolving rights movement must confront to realize its ambition.},

We suggest an explanation based on the transaction costs of Argentina's political market. Although potentially Pareto-improving policies could could have been adopted, they were not introduced because of the uncertainty over the future status of today's bargains, and given the lack of institutions to enforce bargains among the political actors. The paper concludes offering some preliminary ideas for institutional engineering: what governance structures could help reduce these transaction costs? The purpose is to create an institutional framework in which political actors could negotiate among themselves, ensuring the enforceability of agreements, in order to achieve more efficient outcomes.},

In the other regime, it accommodates ex- post the fiscal needs of the different provinces. In this second case, full-insurance results, but the economy is subject to a tragedy of the fiscal commons, with excessive subnational spending, insufficient local taxation, and reduced production of federal public goods.

The analysis shows that SSA has been contributing additional amounts to overall and `per child' education expenditures in all states, especially for new investments to expand provision and improve infrastructure and manpower in the first stage and now to increasingly focus on quality issues. The obligation of providing for these new investments was more on Centre than on states so far, but changing the funding pattern seems to affect the funding of programme. Contrary to the assumptions of Planning Commission that states are flushed with funds and have already been contributing more for the program, states are constrained by increasing budget provisions for non-developmental expenditures and decreasing shares of social sector expenditures on the one hand, and the Fiscal Responsibility regime and weak resource mobilization capacity on the other. Since most of the lagging states have not been able to commit for the year 2007-08 in their state budgets more than what they were already contributing to SSA in the past, the plan size of these states get severely reduced as the Centre would only provide matching share. Even other wise, the burden of providing the matching counterpart funds have been heavier on economically and educationally backward states compared to that on the better off states on account of uniform formulas. Any decision on funding (any) Centrally Sponsored Scheme, instead of adopting a uniform norms for financial and physical targets for all states should take into account (a) the differences in states' current level of provision and outcomes, (b) differential financial requirements to fill the provision gaps, and (c) the fiscal situation in states and their ability to contribute to the program. The Planning Commission, in the case of SSA, should either go back to 75:25 sharing pattern, or should devise a differentiated funding formula applicable to states based on their outcomes, gaps and fiscal capacity. Thus, the incidence of financing SSA should fall differently on states that have already met certain milestones (and hence funding for new plans is limited) and for those states that are lagging behind others in provision as well as in outcomes.},

Indeed, reservations have had a significant positive impact on the democratic participation of women in female sarpanch villages though the positive effects in terms of service delivery and democratic participation will take some more time to materialise.},

We consider the state of educational policy in an era in which market reform advocates often invoke the spirit of the Brown decision even as the Supreme Court has largely vacated the legal framework provided by Brown to desegregate schools. Background: Educational policy post-Brown has focused largely on expanding market reforms such as school choice, high-stakes testing, and federal and state accountability mechanisms in lieu of the radical shifts in the distribution of educational opportunities for which Brown called. Setting: We discuss these marketoriented trends in San Francisco and Philadelphia. Findings: While many of these interventions have contributed to the growing racial, linguistic, and socioeconomic segregation in public education, efforts to realize more just and democratic schooling persist in these same urban school districts. Conclusion: We conclude with a call to educational leaders to partner with local communities to revive Brown's promise for more just, diverse, and equitable schooling.},

Increasing country ownership of the programs is one solution.

We present a transition framework and describe how it was used to transfer the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation's HIV/AIDS prevention program, the Avahan program, to the Government of India. Essential features recommended for the transition of donor-funded programs to governments include early planning with the government, aligning donor program components with government structures and funding models prior to transition, building government capacity through active technical and management support, budgeting for adequate support during and after the transition, and dividing the transition into phases to allow time for adjustments and corrections. The transition of programs to governments is an important sustainability strategy for efforts to scale up HIV prevention programs to reach the populations most at risk.},

Finally, university educational attainment is associated with decreasing tolerance.},

It argues that social audits have not performed well in the National Rural Employment Guarantee (NREG) scheme because of three problems. First, conceptually, it has been unable to resolve the question of hierarchy. In a social audit, the relationship between the auditors (who include villagers and NGOs) and the bureaucrats is weakly hierarchical; the NGOs and villagers are part of the citizenry who elect political representatives, and these politicians in turn oversee the bureaucracy implementing the scheme. Second, operationally, the feeble hierarchical relationship weakens the enforceability of sanctions against errant officials and produces a disconnect between the substantive goals of the scheme and the procedural standards followed by bureaucrats. Third, the assumption underlying the social audit that given a chance, the community will monitor such schemes is also problematic. The paper highlights the arguments by assessing the performance of NREG social audits in three states \textemdash{} Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.},

The paper assesses whether socially and politically networked households do in fact have better awareness of the components of the program and of the processes of decision making, and whether such networking makes them more likely to vocalize their dissatisfaction when their entitlements are threatened. India's national rural employment guarantee scheme's (NREG) institutional design (mandating village assemblies to authorize decisions on the projects) makes it a good test case. Our results show that links to social and political networks do significantly increase the awareness of the villagers on the program's components and enhances their ability to seek redress of their grievances.},

I use a mixed-methods case study of Sierra Leone's child protection sector, combining qualitative process tracing with a randomized field experiment, to provide initial evidence about the dynamics of international- local co-production and the extent to which the political consequences of such arrangements can be transformed by Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The qualitative analysis reveals that the creation of both of community-based social welfare providers by international organizations was hampered by Sierra Leone's difficult geography and the disjuncture between the rights-based focus of the international agencies and local norms defining childhood and child welfare. The results of the randomized field experiment indicate that the use of mobile phone technology can be effective at strengthening international-local co- production, but that the use of this technology also enables both partners to more effectively ``skip the state''. *Acknowledgements:},

I find that localities with no formal punishments for littering experienced sustained reductions in littering behavior and increases in the frequency of public clean-ups. In contrast, communities in which government administrators or traditional leaders could punish littering experienced short-term reductions in littering behavior that were not sustained over time.

Meanwhile, political scientists are also becoming more interested in the use of multilevel models (MLM). However, little work exists to understand the benefits of multi- level modeling when applied to TSCS data. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to bench- mark the performance of a Bayesian multilevel model for TSCS data. We find that the MLM performs as well or better than other common estimators for such data. Most importantly, the MLM is more general and offers researchers additional advantages. 1},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {This mixed-methods paper investigates whether the `private school premium', as manifested in student learning outcomes, is the result of better-quality teaching in private schools. Using school-, community- and household-level data from the Young Lives longitudinal study in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, this paper makes a detailed comparison of 227 government and private schools attended by the children in the sample. We use detailed information on school-based components and information from classroom observation, as well as household- and individual-level information and qualitative interviews, for our analysis. We look at the effect of teaching quality on children's test scores, controlling for lagged test scores of children and for several household-, child-, class- and school-level characteristics. The results from our regression analysis suggest that children in private schools have a significantly higher (at 1 per cent) mathematics score than children in government schools. A key finding is that specific teacher characteristics and practices have emerged as important factors in determining children's learning outcomes. While standard characteristics of teachers like experience, gender, content knowledge and subject specialisation do not have any significant influence on children's learning outcome, teaching practices such as regularity in checking homework and factors such as the proximity of the teacher's residence to the school and teachers' attitude towards the children, as well as teachers' perceptions of their schools, have emerged as important determinants of students' test scores. In short, it is what the teacher `believes and does' in the classroom that has the maximum impact on children's learning outcomes. Another key finding of our analysis is that the students of teachers with professional qualifications have significantly higher outcomes (at 10 per cent in value-added specification) than children taught by teachers with only senior secondary education. Students of teachers with Bachelors or Masters degrees in Education do not have significantly better outcomes than those taught by teachers with general degrees, after controlling for other factors. This has significant implications for policy formulation regarding teacher recruitment and pre- service teacher training, as well as the development of regulatory frameworks for both the public and private education sectors, in light of the Right to Education Act, 2009. There is a need to shift from a focus on pure credentials, such as education-related qualifications, to an examination of the content and process adopted by pre-service training courses, with a view to enhancing teachers' competencies in effective instructional strategies, so that students get the instruction they deserve. Setting standards for teaching and learning, to create appropriate benchmarks for both government and private schools, is the need of the hour and should be addressed as a matter of urgency},

India's reform trajectory can be understood in terms of three distinct phases of reforms interspersed by periods of slowdown. In this narrative that goes beyond 1991, an analysis of struggles, opponents, and reversals become important, revealing a more contested pathway. In the 2000s India has moved beyond the initial, crisis-driven phase to a deeper external integration with the global economy and structural reform within. I call this phase an era of strategic internationalization. Reforms of 1985, 1991, and 1998\textendash 2000, in different ways, have begun to create new constituencies of support across India, which underlies the consolidation phase of reforms. During this long trajectory, the opponents of reforms could delay reforms but failed to reverse the direction of economic reforms. The purpose of this article is to provide a temporal framework that pays attention to mechanisms underlying different phases of reforms and how new supporters and opponents of reforms were created across different phases of the reform trajectory. Policies, the social bases of the Indian economy, and classes have been re-configured as a result.},

Long criticized by quantitatively oriented methodologists, this canonical approach has increasingly been critiqued by qualitative methodologists who recom- mend greater focus on within-case analysis and the confinement of causal explanations to particular cases. Such advice accords with a welcome shift from a combative ``tale of two cultures'' toward mutual respect for research combining qualitative and quantitative methods in the simultaneous pursuit of internal and external validity. This article argues that controlled comparisons remain indispensable amid this ``multimethod turn,'' explicating how they too can generate both internal and external validity when their practitioners (a) craft arguments with general variables or mechanisms, (b) seek out rep- resentative variation, and (c) select cases that maximize control over alterna- tive explanations. When controlled comparisons meet these standards, they continue to illuminate the world's great convergences and divergences across nation-states in a manner that no other methods can surpass.},

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Scholars, such as Alexis de Tocqueville, have long pointed out that the key to American democracy was an involved citizenry. More recently, we have come to understand that ``social capital'' can ease the costs of that participation. Using survey data from South Bend and Indianapolis, Indiana, I show that variations in the structure of both networks and associations shape their impact on political participation, civic activities, or even ``exiting'' from the neighborhood. In particular, focusing on two dimensions of the network\textemdash social space and geographic space\textemdash I am able to show that the geographic concentration of the network is an important resource for supporting local activities, such as participation in neighborhood associations. Ties stretching across social space, on the other hand, are more supportive of traditional measures of political participation\textemdash such as campaigning. By the same logic, the impact of neighborhood associations is also shaped by their structure. Associations with strong leadership and coercive powers, for example, are able to provide public services that discourage exit from the neighborhood. Nor do these associations exist in isolation from other forms of social capital. Certain configurations of interpersonal networks may enable the monitoring of reticent association leadership, while, on the other hand, carefully designed associations may stimulate the flow of information lacking in the local networks. Such a structural approach to social capital, I argue, avoids many of the tautologies that have plagued the concept, leaving us with a tool for both embedding individuals into a social context while acknowledging their ability to influence that context through their design decisions. Should it reach its potential, social capital promises a central role in the creation of a second generation of rationality models.},

As Chilean schooling spread and became sys- tematized over the course of the nineteenth century, local state offi cials not only ef- fectively carried out the state's educational policies but also refi ned it independently and even pushed for the deepening of educational development, and particularly the systematic control of schooling.},

Prominent works on the relationship between democracy and eco- nomic inequality center on the expectation by economic elites that democratization will lead to economic redistribution. But state capacity is necessary for redistribution, and where extractive capacity is lacking, rational economic elites should not fear that suffrage expansion would lead to effective redistribution, nor should the masses expect to gain economically from democratization. State capacity thus acts as a scope condition for the effect of inequality on regime outcomes. This prediction is confirmed through replication and extension of the analysis in Boix (2003), with the addition of the presence of a regularly implemented national census as a proxy for state capacity. In strong states, the effect of inequality on regime change is confirmed. But where the state is weak, inequality is shown to have no effect on regime outcomes. Thus, including state capacity in theories of regime change calls into question general claims about the ``economic origins'' of dictatorship and democracy.},

The current study uses the legislative removal of a cap on the maximum number of charters in North Carolina as a natural experiment to assess the impacts of charter school growth on teacher quality and student composition in traditional public schools (TPS) at different levels of local market penetration. Using an instrumental variable difference-in-differences approach to account for endogenous charter demand, we find that intensive local charter entry reduces the inflow of new teachers at nearby TPS, leading to a more experienced and credentialed teaching workforce on average. However, we find that the entry of charters serving predominantly White students leads to reductions in average teacher experience, effective\- ness, and credentials at nearby TPS. Overall these findings suggest that the composition of the teacher workforce in TPS will continue to change as charter schools further expand, and that the spillover effects of future charter expansion will vary by the types of students served by charters.},

Combining theoretical concepts from new institutional economics and the sociological variant of new institutionalism in organisational theory, empirical results from this study on LFP schooling in Lucknow District, Uttar Pradesh counter such assumptions. Far from being a fragmented set of schools, LFP schools employed the shadow institutional framework, a codified yet informal set of norms and procedures, to operate as part of a distinct private schooling sector. Despite the fact that LFP case study schools were independently owned, managed, and financed, they used the shadow framework to manipulate and mediate the formal policy and regulatory framework for their benefit and formed part of the de facto LFP sector, a sub-sector of the greater private unaided sector. Even though the shadow framework was contrary to or usurped the official regulatory and policy framework, it operated with the knowledge and sometimes full participation of institutional actors who propelled it as a vehicle for legitimacy because of perverse incentives embedded in the formal framework. The article presents the specific norms and procedures comprising the shadow framework, and outlines the potential implications of this new private schooling sector on the provision and delivery of schooling for disadvantaged groups.},

Private schools are mandated to allocate 25\% of their seats for free via `freeships' for socially and economically disadvantaged children. Furthermore, the Act has a number of provisions attempting to ease barriers to admission and entry to all schools, including private schools. This paper reports household-level data on the schooling patterns, experiences, and perceptions in one Delhi slum accessing schooling based on a survey of 290 households and 40 semi-structured household interviews. We found very low instances of children with private school freeships. Furthermore, children in`free'private school seats incurred the second highest costs of accessing schooling after full-fee-paying students in relatively high-fee private schools. Finally, households accessing freeships and higher-fee schools experienced considerable barriers to securing a seat and admission.},

It provides a review of the economics literature in this area to elucidate the implications of recent policy changes on efficiency, costs, and quality. Our review reveals that there has been some convergence in policies adopted across countries to improve financing incentives and encourage efficient use of health services. In the case of risk pooling, all countries with competing pools experience similar difficulties with selection and are adopting more sophisticated forms of risk adjustment. In the case of hospital competition, the key drivers of success appear to be what is competed on and measurable, rather than whether the system is public or private. In the case of both the success of performance-related pay for providers and issues resulting from wait times, evidence differs within and across jurisdictions. However, the evidence does suggest that some governments have effectively reduced wait times when they have chosen explicitly to focus on achieving this goal. Many countries are exploring new ways of generating revenues for health care to enable them to cope with significant cost growth, but there is little evidence to suggest that collection mechanisms alone are effective in managing the cost or quality of care.

Yet while much attention has been focused on the origins of electoral violence, we know little about the long-run consequences of this form of ``outsourced'' violence. The puzzle driving this paper is why, following initial electoral militarization, armed groups are co-opted into ruling parties, violently turn on their former government allies, persist as enduringly armed parts of the political system, or are quickly suppressed when no longer useful. I analytically identify these trajectories as incorporation, blowback, normalization, and purging. The paper argues that post-militarization trajectories are driven by the intersection of government political interests and armed group organizational autonomy. Comparative evidence from South Asia shows the importance of these concepts and processes, which are relevant to a much broader range of cases. The specter of violence needs be firmly integrated into the study of elections, state building, and political order.},

  abstract = {In recent years several democratically elected African governments have abol- ished primary school fees following pledges made during presidential election campaigns. Among these cases, Uganda's universal primary education (UPE) programme, launched in 1997, has received particular attention, due to the massive increase in primary school enrolment, as well the sustained increase in public spending on education that it has entailed. This paper asks whether the Ugandan government's policies in this area can be explained by the prior estab- lishment of competitive elections in 1996. It provides several reasons to believe that the move to UPE has indeed been linked to democratic politics, and that this outcome has depended on the salience of education as an issue, as well as on the public's access to information about UPE. As a result, recent Ugandan exper- ience helps show why the establishment of competitive elections might prompt an African government to spend more on primary education. However, it also suggests why in many African countries a democratic transition will have little effect on primary education provision.},

There have been even fewer attempts to investigatewhether democracy matters for public spending in the poorest developing countries, where ``weak institutions'' maymean that the formal adoption of electoral competition has little effect on policy. In this article I confront these questions directly, asking whether the shift to multiparty competition in African countries has resulted in increased spending on primary education. I develop an argument, illustrated with a game-theoretic model, which suggests that the need to obtain an electoral majority may have prompted African governments to spend more on education and to prioritize primary schools over universities within the education budget. I test three propositions from the model using panel data on electoral competition and education spending in African countries. I find clear evidence that democratically elected African governments have spent more on primary education, while spending on universities appears unaffected by democratization.},

She addresses why Americans invested in public education  and explains how an array of reformers subtly transformed schooling into  a tool of social governance to address the consequences of  industrialization and urbanization. By extending the reach of schools,  broadening their mandate, and expanding their authority over the  well-being of children, the state assumed a defining role in the  education\textemdash and in the lives\textemdash of American families.In School, Society, and State,  Steffes returns the state to the study of the history of education and  brings the schools back into our discussion of state power during a  pivotal moment in American political development.},

However, the asymptotic justification of widely employed estimation strategies presumes large samples and applications in comparative politics routinely involve only a small number of countries. Thus, researchers and reviewers often wonder if these models are applicable at all. In other words, how many countries do we need for multilevel modeling? I present results from a large-scale Monte Carlo experiment comparing the performance of multilevel models when few countries are available. I find that maximum likelihood estimates and confidence intervals can be severely biased, especially in models including cross-level interactions. In contrast, the Bayesian approach proves to be far more robust and yields considerably more conservative tests.},

We test our arguments using historical, county-level data on post-U.S. Civil War Reconstruction and we supply both quantitative and qualitative evidence for our mechanisms.

This result complements the literature on political cycles by demonstrating how campaign funds are raised rather than used.

One such instance occurred in the Colonial Indian provinces, where incumbent elites hollowed out tax capacity in anticipation of franchise expansion. While studies of intra-elite competition have focused on economic inequality as a key factor in shaping elite motivations, this paper finds that high-caste elites in the colonial era, who were worried about their status dominance, weakened institutions in order to limit the ability of future elected lower castes to integrate public goods to lower castes. As elite bureaucrats as well as local tax collectors, upper castes enabled tax avoidance and exited the local bureaucratic machinery. Using a historical dataset from 1914-1925 and novel micro-level measures of land tax collection, tax avoidance, and the size of the bureaucracy, the paper demonstrates that bureaucratic capacity declined after franchise expansion in the districts with higher levels of inter-caste status inequality.},

While public Muslim support for the Bharatiya Janata Party did not translate into electoral support in most places, there are important exceptions to this trend \textendash{} and at least in the case of Uttar Pradesh, their support for competing parties followed a fairly complex spatial pattern. We further explore this spatial variation in Muslim vote pattern by looking at the moderating impact of minority concentration, violent communal history, and ethnic coordination and conclude with a call for more disaggregated research.},

Such a scheme could cover about two-thirds of households, and make far larger transfers to the poorest compared to the actual subsidy embedded in the current system, eliminating the risk of large exclusion errors. Further, the overall budget can be held at the present outlay level. It is argued that most of the objections to such a transfer scheme can be circumvented at the design stage.},

But do private schools make students better or do they simply cream skim better students? In this article I take advantage of the remarkable fact that in many districts in India a majority of students attend private schools. As the private share of school enrollment increases, cream skimming becomes less plausible as the explanation for a higher rate of achievement in private schools. Evidence for cream skimming is found when the private share of schooling is low, in the range of 0\textendash 15\%, and thus private schools have a large public pool from which to skim. But the private effect on achievement does not appear to diminish greatly even in districts where more than 70\% of students are in private schools. Most importantly, mean scores taken over the entire population of students, private and public, increase with the share of private schooling. These findings support a significant productivity effect of private schools.},

This article extends the study of this global paradox to the non-Western world by considering how it manifests within India, the world's biggest democracy. Arguments derived from studies of advanced democracies (such as values voting) or of poor polities (such as patronage and ethnic appeals) fail to explain this important phenomenon. Instead, I outline a novel strategy predicated on an electoral division of labor enabling elite parties to recruit the poor while retaining the rich. Recruitment is outsourced to nonparty affiliates that provide basic services to appeal to poor communities. Such outsourcing permits the party to maintain programmatic linkages to its elite core. Empirically, I test this argument with qualitative and quantitative evidence, including a survey of more than 9,000 voters. Theoretically, I argue that this approach is best suited to elite parties with thick organizations, typically those linked to religious social movements.},

  abstract = {Despite rapid urbanization across the Global South, identity politics within rural-urban migrant communities remains understudied. Past scholarship is divided over whether village-based ethnic divisions will erode or deepen within diverse poor migrant populations. I assess these divergent predictions through an `ethnographic survey experiment' (N=4,218) among unique samples of poor migrants in India. Contra conventional expectations, I find intra-class ethnic divisions are neither uniformly transcended nor entrenched across key arenas of migrant life. Instead, I observe variation consistent with situational theories predicting ethnic divisions will be muted only in contexts triggering a common identity among migrants. I pinpoint urban employers and politicians as these triggers. Poor migrants ignore ethnic divisions when facing these elites, who perceive and treat them in class terms. However, migrants remain divided in direct interactions with each other. These bifurcated findings imply poor migrants may be available for both class-based and ethnic mobilization in the city.},

  abstract = {Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities. Making use of research on this topic over the past decade, this paper summarizes the current state of our knowledge about how people engage in mental accounting activities. Three components of mental accounting receive the most attention. This first captures how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and subsequently evaluated. The accounting system provides the inputs to be both ex ante and ex po.st cost-benefit analyses. A second com- ponent of mental accounting involves the assignment of activities to specific accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds are labeled in real as well as in mental accounting systems. Expenditures are grouped into categories (housing, food, etc.) and spending is sometimes constrained by implicit or explicit budgets. The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which accounts are evaluated and 'choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily, weekly, yearly, and so on, and can be defined narrowly or broadly. Each of the components of mental accounting violates the economic principle of fungibility. As a result, mental accounting influences choice, that is, it matters.},

After a decade of experimentation with new rights-based approaches to social policy at the national level, there is a pressing need to understand how regional political environments influence the ways in which policies are initiated and enacted on the ground. Written by political scientists and a sociologist with expertise across India\^as regions, this volume presents comparative analyses of the emergent politics of welfare across Indian states. Bringing together ground-level empirical data and innovative perspectives, it investigates the ways in which state-level political dynamics shape policies in the fields of education, health insurance, social security, employment, and food subsidies.

  abstract = {It is the accepted wisdom in development circles that it is a matter for governments and bilateral/ multilateral agencies to solve the problem of achieving `education for all'. This is curious, for in other areas of our lives the opposite assumption is accepted \textendash{} even by Nobel Laureate, Amartya Sen, who points to the crucial role of markets in achieving high economic growth, poverty reduction and freedom. Why is education an exception? Why isn't the education community worried about the impact on the poor of the unaccountable `powerful bureaucracies' cited by Sen as dangers of state-sponsored development? The emphasis of development experts is especially odd given studies that have shown the relative superiority of private over public education in developing countries, in terms of achievement and cost-effectiveness. However, although such studies have controlled for socio-economic status and self-selection bias, the assumption is that private schools serve the upper classes and so are irrelevant to debates about the poor. This report challenges this assumption. It outlines research investigating the phenomenon of private schools serving low-income families in Hyderabad, India, and suggests that the development community's dismissal of a valuable role for the private sector in meeting the educational needs of the poor is unwarranted. In particular, the research set out to explore how an external agency might be able to assist with capacity building in private schools serving the poor. To this end, fifteen schools were opportunistically selected from the huge number of private schools serving low-income families in Hyderabad. Within these schools, random samples of parents and children, all of the teachers and all but one of the entrepreneurs, were interviewed in-depth to build up a comprehensive picture of the schools, their successes and shortcomings. The official regulations were also examined in detail and interviews with senior politicians and civil servants conducted to explore the extent to which the regulatory environment was met in practice. The study revealed a huge private sector serving poor families in the slums. Official figures from Hyderabad District revealed 61\% of pupils in the private unaided sector, in a thousand such schools. The project schools were found to have average fees of about \textsterling 2 per month, an average student-teacher ratio of 29:1 and a majority of teachers who were graduates. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the burgeoning of the sector, it was found that running schools, even for low-income families, was potentially a profitable undertaking, with estimated profits of about 25\%. Fathers were found to be largely daily-paid labourers and 30\% of mothers were illiterate, but families were active in the school choice process, with over two thirds having investigated at least two schools in addition to the one finally selected. Finally, the mystery of how so many schools could be established, when there was such an all-embracing regulatory framework, was solved when the extra-legal sector was revealed, with the great majority of regulations ignored, subject to the payment of bribes.},

At the state level, extensive regulations govern all aspects of a school's work.

  abstract = {Chapter 1: Background and sample1.The current study builds on earlier research highlighting the role private schools are playing in Lagos State, Nigeria. The National Population Commission and Newcastle University conducted a household survey of a representativesample of over 1,000 households across the whole of Lagos State. A random sample of 101 Census Enumeration Areas (EAs) was selected, and within these a random sample of 10 households. The person or persons responsible for making decisions about education in each household was interviewed by a trained researcher. Chapter 2: Children, families and schools2.The sample consisted of 2,290 children between the ages of three to 14, in 1,005 households. Girls made up 48.6 percent of the sample,  while  ``wards''  were7.4 percent. Using a Lagos-specific poverty line of Naira 112,895 per person per annum, with the caveat that households may have under-reported income, gave around 53 percent of households living on or below the poverty line. 3.Families are predominantly using private schools for their children. In the sample, 69.8 percent of children are in private schools, compared to 26.4 percent in public. Out of school children make up only 3.9 percent of the sample \textendash but only 1.3 percent of the sample are aged five to14 and not awaiting placement in secondary schools. 4.Primary school is predominantly in the private sector, with 72.8 percent of primary children in private school. Pre-primary school is essentially private \textendash 91.0 percent of pre-primary children are in private  school.  Secondary  level  is  mixed:  although  this  wasn't  the main focus of this study, we found around 50 percent of secondary enrolment in the public sector. Chapter 3: Private schools and affordability 5.`Low-cost'  private  schools  are those affordable by a family on or below the poverty line, if total fees for all children in school amount to between 10 to 11 percent of total family income. Private schools charging total fees (including for tuition, registration, development, sports, PTA, exams, report cards and graduation) of Naira 25,000 per annum  or  lower  are  classified  as  `low-cost'  private  schools.  `Medium  cost'  and  `high  cost'  are  defined  in  relation  to  this. Page |  26.About one fifth of the total sample (21.8 percent) of children is using low-cost private schools, while nearly a quarter is in medium cost (24.0 percent) and high cost (23.9 percent) private schools.  7.For families on or below the poverty line, 50 percent precisely are using private schools for all their children, while a further 20.7 percent uses a mixture of public and private. Only 20 percent of families on or below the poverty line use public schools only. That is, 71 percent of the poorest families in the sample use private schools for all or some of their children. 8.Concerning enrolment, 69 percent of children in low-cost private schools are living on or below the poverty line, compared to 73 percent of children in public schools. There is no statistically significant difference in the percentage of the poor enrolled in low-cost privateschools or public schools.9.Investigating school choice by per capita income decile, it is striking how similar the patterns are for choice of public and low-cost private school. Similar percentages use both at each incomedecile, declining with increasingincome. Crossing above the poverty line leads to a particularly sharp decline in enrolment. Chapter4: Some child and family characteristics10.Girls are neither under-represented in private schools nor in higher levels of schooling: there are no statistically significant differences in gender enrolment in different school management types or levels of schooling. Wards of households however are significantly more likely to be in public than private schools. 11.Families most closely linked with being in poverty are those headed by single mothers, grandparent or grandparents without parents present, and fathers with more than one wife. Conversely, the family structure of two parents with their children and three-generational families are less likely to be associated with poverty. 12.Two-parent families are more likely to send their children to private than public schools: 81.7 percent of children in low-cost private schools are from two-parent families, compared to 70.8 percent in public schools. 13.It is noticeablehow similar households using public and low-cost private schools are, and how different these are from other households. On indicators such as percentage of primary earners on monthly salaries, percentage of mothers with no schooling, number of bedrooms in the house, number of cellphones in the family, percentage with a car, total family income and per capita income, children using public schools are very similar to children using low-cost private schools. There are differences, however, in family structure and percentage of fathers who have had secondary level schooling (47.4 percent low-cost private compared to 35.1 percent public).  Page |  3Chapter 5: School choice, by level of schooling and income14.School choice by income, disaggregated in terms of level of income, shows that the earlier observation (8 above) of how close public and low-cost private schools are is even more pronounced when primary school children only are investigated. Similar percentages use both at each income decile, declining with increasingincome. Crossing above the poverty line leads to a particularly sharp decline in enrolment.Chapter 6: Schooling costs \textendash comparing public and private 15.Public schools also charge some ``levies''. The vast majority (94.9 percent) of public schools would be included  as  `low-cost'  taking  into  account  these  levies.  Taking  into  account  `extra  spend'  on  education,  such  as  for  uniform,  books,  stationery,  food,  transport, clubs, and outside tuition, brings more convergence between public and low-cost private schools.  More  families  using  public  schools  are  in  the  `medium'  and  `high'  extra spend categories than families using low-cost private schools \textendash 41.0 percent of public school families are medium extra spend, compared to 39.0 percent of low-cost private school families, while 27.8 percent of public school families are higher extra spend, compared to 21.3 percent of low-cost private school families. 16.There is considerable overlap between families using public and low-cost private schools by total education expenditure (i.e., adding all fees and extra expenditure). 35.3 percent of total expenditure in low-cost private schools is in the second wealth quintile,compared to 22.0 percent in public schools. Chapter 7: Choosing a School \textendash who decides and how?17.Parents tendto  stay  `in  their  own  camp':  74.1  percent  of  families  using  public  schools  did not investigate any private schools, while 83.6 percent of those using low-cost private schools did not investigate any public schools. The mean number of schools investigated is low: 0.41 schools for public, 1.38 for low-cost private and 2.1 for high-cost private. 18.For the vast majority of children (around 80 percent in all school types), both mother and father together make school choices for their children. Grandmothers make choices nearly three times more than grandfathers (7.6 percent compared to 3.2 percent, for instance, for low-cost private school choice). 19.The major source of information to inform school choice is school visits \textendash used by 75.5 percent of families \textendash followed  by  talking  to  the  families'  network  of  friends,  neighbours  and relatives (53.9 percent), and observing children from the school (35.5 percent of families).  Parents choosing each different management type had the same three  Page |  4priorities, although considerably more families using low-cost private schools than other types pointed to the importance of observing children from the school. Chapter 8: Reasons for school choice 20.The three main reasons for choice of low-cost private schools most commonly reported were proximity to home (61.7 percent), better quality teachers (46.1 percent) and better quality school (45.1 percent). For public school choice, proximity to home is also first (52.3 percent), followed by good discipline (48.3 percent) and school reputation (43.0 percent).  21.Asked to choose one reason only that guided school choice, better quality teachers came in top (chosen by 22.8 percent of respondents), followed by better quality school (19.5 percent), good discipline (13.4 percent) and proximity to home (12.3 percent).Chapter 9: Moving schools 22.Most children moving between schools move from private to other private schools (79.9 percent of 380 movers). It is clear that some parents are discriminating between different private schools in terms ofboth cost and quality. Moves from private to public were mostly (75 percent) because the parents could no longer afford private school, while moves  in  the  opposite  direction  were  largely  because  of  dissatisfaction  with  the  child's  academic performance (71percent). Chapter 10: Which is better, public or private?23.Families overwhelming believe private is better than public. For personal requirements, families in each of the wealth categories, including the poorest, favour private schools. They believe private schools are open the hours they require, are responsive to their complaints, and are near to their homes. Affordability is the only issue where public schools rate higher. For all quality issues, families in each of the wealth categories again favour private over public schools. 24.The same is true even when we look at which schools families actually use. For personal requirements, families using public as well as private favour private schools. For quality issues, families using public and private believe that facilities, class size, discipline, teachers teaching when they should, etc., are better in private than public schools. The only issue where families using public schools rate public higher than private concerns teachers being well-trained. But in spite of teachers being better trained in public than private, this does not lead to a perception of higher quality in public schools.  Page |  5Chapter 11: Towards a statistical model25.Five different logistic regression models were created based on the four schooltypes (public, low, medium and high cost private) and out of school children. 11 variables were  used,  including  two  created  from  factor  analysis  of  family  assets  (`modern'  and  `traditional'  wealth).  26.Regarding the likelihood of choosing apublic school, older children and those who are higher in the family ordering are more likelyto go to public schools. Conversely, children from two-parent families, families with higher incomes, more modern wealth and with better educated fathers are less likelyto send children to public schools. 27.Concerning low-cost  private  schools,  families  with  more  `traditional'  wealth  and  from two parent families are more likely to choose low-cost private schools. Conversely, older children are less likely to go to low-cost private schools, as are those from families with more modern wealth and with better educated mothers. 28.Disaggregating by school level, for primary schools, older children, those higher in the family order, wards of households, and those with less educated fathers and less modern wealth are more likely to go to public school. Children with less educated mothers and from families with less modern wealth are also more likely to go to low-cost private schools. Chapter 12: Reasons for school choice: regression models29.Families choosing public or low-cost private schools put less emphasis on perceived quality as a major reason for school choice than families choosing medium and high cost private schools. This is also true for pre-primary and primary children, when we disaggregate by levels of schooling. Conversely, affordability and closeness to home appear much more important to families using low-cost private schools than other types of private school. 30.The perceived quality of a school is more important for families with  higher  mother's  education and modern wealth, in general, and in particular for parents of primary school children. Fees and costs, as well as proximity to home, become less important as modern wealth increases, in general; the first two are also true for primary school children in particular. Discipline becomes a more important criterion for older children, and as modern wealth increases. Chapter 13: Choosing a school \textendash regression analysis31.Few families get no information about the school, but there is a significantly higher proportion among those sending their child to public school than for any of the private school categories. There was no significant difference between families using different  Page |  6school types as to the extent they talked to others aboutschool choice. Families who sent their child to public school were less likely to have visited the school or observed teachers or pupils than those going to private schools (there was no difference in private school categories). 32.Families getting no information  for  school  choice  tend  to  have  lower  mother's  education  and lower levels of modern wealth. There were no significant background variables relating  to  family's  tendency  to  talk  to  others  about  school  choice.  The  tendency  to  visit  and observe the school  is  related  positively  to  mother's  education,  and  to  the  father  having been in private education. The tendency to collect information about the school is positively  related  to  modern  wealth,  father's  education  and  mother's  education.  The  tendency for grandparents to have more of a say in school choice is more likely for younger  children  and  where  the  mother's  education  is  lower.  Grandparents  are  also  more  likely to have a say in the school choice of wards of households},

The headline findings are that there are no significant academic differences between voucher winners and losers in Telugu, mathematics, English, and science/social studies, although because the private schools appear to use time more efficiently, they are also able to teach Hindi (the national language). The average per capita cost in private schools is less than a third of that in public schools. So while private schools are more efficient, they are not necessarily leading to higher standards. There are two types of private school in the experiment, English and Telugu medium. Since tests in non-language subjects were conducted in a different language for children in public and English-medium private schools, the results in mathematics and science/social studies are difficult to interpret. There are suggestive comparisons between children in Telugu-medium private and public schools, where children took tests in the same language (and were also not subject to disruption in medium of instruction), which show that students in private schools outperform those in public in all subjects. This suggests that giving children access to private schools through vouchers could be a very important policy reform.},

Economic and political theories-from Tiebout to Weingast- emphasize advantages of decentralization. Yet, recent experience-from Yugoslavia and Russia to Argentina and Brazil-suggests that decentralization may at times interact with economic liberalization to exacerbate fiscal, macroeconomic, or even territorial instabil- ity. This paper suggests a logic that can account for such cases. A simple, game-theoretic model is used to analyze interactions between central and local officials in a two-level state with significant cultural divisions. It finds that decentralization or local democrati- zation increases the level of central redistribution required to prevent spirals of regional revolt. Consequences of economic reforms that have characteristics of public goods de- pend critically on the initial levels of cultural division and decentralization. In relatively centralized or homogeneous states, such reforms lead to virtuous cycles of growth and increased revenues and state capacity. In decentralized and deeply divided ones, the same reforms can lead to vicious cycles of higher redistribution, economic inefficiency, and political instabili},

How did East German firms respond to the free market after being thrust into it in 1990? We use a formal learning model and German business survey data to analyze the lasting impact of this far-reaching treatment on the way firms in former East Germany predicted their own productivity relative to firms in former West Germany during the two decades since Reunification. We find in confirmation of our formal model's predictions, that Eastern firms forecast productivity less accurately, particularly in dynamic and uncertain markets, but that the gap gradually closed over 12 to 13 years. Second, by analyzing the direction of firm level errors in conjunction with contemporaneous market signals we find that, in the years immediately following Reunification, Eastern firms estimate the market's role as generally less potent than Western firm do, an observation consistent with overweighting experiences from the communist era; however, over roughly 14 years both converge to the same (incorrect) overestimate of the market's role on their productivity.},

  abstract = {Public goods in the United States are largely funded and delivered at the local level. Local public goods are valuable, but their production requires overcoming several collective action problems including coordinating supply and minimizing congestion, free-riding, and peer effects. Land use regulations, promulgated by local governments, allow communities to solve the collective action problems inherent in the provision of local public goods and maintenance of property values. A consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial segregation.},

In developing countries, the rural population can promote welfare policy expansion, but it is middle-class interests that shape the direction of policy development. Second, given the importance of politics, conceptualiza- tions of welfare policies need to include both the spending and the financing side. Finally, the causes of different welfare regime paths need to be examined with attention to the particular economic contexts of developing countries and how welfare and economic policies are interrelated and to some extent path dependent.},

This paper explores the conditions under which political parties select candidates with serious criminal records to contest elections in India, the world's largest democracy. I argue that criminally indicted politicians benefit parties when they can exploit social divisions to build a compelling case that their criminality gives them an advantage in serving the interests of their fellow co-ethnics. In particular, I hypothesize that criminality is likely to be lower in constituencies constitutionally reserved for protected minorities and in indirectly elected bodies, where caste divisions are less salient. In reserved constituencies, however, the salience of caste is likely to vary with the size of the minority population. Using a unique dataset drawn from candidate affidavits, this paper finds support for these hypotheses. This paper serves as a reminder that the selection of bad politicians by political parties is both strategic and highly contextual.},

  abstract = {For the past two decades, the framework of core and swing voters has been the analytical workhorse for the comparative literature on distributive politics. In this paper, we argue for a minimal definition of core and swing that only depends on margin of victory within the constituency. Such a definition allows us evaluate distributional patterns of pork as a function of electoral pressures. We demonstrate these insights using a unique dataset on the patterns of public school construction in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu from 1977-2007. Using multilevel modeling (MLM) statistical techniques with time-series data, we find that there is a spike in school building in the first two years of a new state government consistent with a pattern of "vote rewarding." Furthermore, while there is a general pattern of rewarding core voters, MLM techniques allow us to identify heterogeneous effects across elections. We find that ruling party state legislators target schools in "swing" constituencies when there are a disproportionately large number of close races in the state. Thus, while ruling party politicians might prefer to reward their most ardent supporters, they are constrained by electoral realities.},

  abstract = {Esping-Andersen developed a typology of welfare regimes: conservative, liberal and social democratic, which are measured on the basis of seven indicators. We re-examine Esping-Andersen's data as well as replication data compiled by Scruggs and Allan to show that the seven indicators do not form valid measures of thesewelfare regimes. In addition to divergences in theirmeasurement, the seven indicators are a mixture of institutional characteristics of welfare systems and outcome measures of social stratification. A measurement model based on the five institutional characteristics of welfare regimes that pertain to social insurance, however, does fit both the original and replication data. This article therefore proposes a three-dimensional model of conservative and liberal social insurance, which treats universal insurance coverage as the third dimension, instead of Esping-Andersen's `socialist' regime. Although this does not fundamentally alter the typology of countries, it has implications for previous studies that employ country scores based on Esping-Andersen's method as independent variables in causal models. To illustrate these implications, this article re-examines a study by Noe\textasciidieresis{} land The\textasciiacute{} rien and calls into question their conclusions on the causal connections between the social democratic welfare state and levels of foreign aid.},

Drawing on standard models of political competition, I argue that there will be a selection bias inherent in estimating the impact of noncitizen suffrage on public policy and analyze data that are uniquely suitable to deal with this methodological problem, namely data on exogenous changes in the composition of the electorates of Swedish municipalities generated by the introduction of noncitizen suffrage. According to the results, the effect of enfranchising noncitizens on public policy was large, causing spending on education and social and family services to increase substantially in municipalities where noncitizens made up a nonnegligible share of the electorate.},

Despite these facts we know little about what drives quality of care in the private sector and why patients continue to seek care from poor quality providers. We use two field studies in India that provide unique insight into this issue. First, we use a discrete choice experiment to show that patients are willing to pay higher prices for better technical quality (defined by correct treatment and correct diagnosis). Second, we use standardized patients to show that private providers who provide better technical quality are not able to charge higher prices. Instead providers are able to charge higher prices for elements of quality that the patient can observe (good patient interactions and more effort), which are less important for health outcomes. Taken together, this research highlights a market inefficiency and suggests that engaging patients with accessible information on technical quality of the providers in their community could shift demand to providers that provide better care and thus improve health outcomes.},

Drawing on Lawrence Cohen's recent writing on ethical publicity I argue that the work of transparency activists is directed at producing an ``ethical scene'' in which their poor clients are encouraged to understand themselves as potentially empowered citizens of a nation wounded by corruption and bad governance. However, this ethical scene is partly framed by exclusionary middle-class discourses about corruption, dirty politics, and brokerage that problematize the need for the urban poor to negotiate their existence in the city through informal mediated connections to political and bureaucratic power. The same mediated connections between ``political society'' and the local state which transparency and accountability activists work to expose and reform. Furthermore, my ethnography shows how the process of promoting and implementing transparency mechanisms in the social and political context of urban India produces new relationships of brokerage between activists and those who seek their assistance as expert mediators with the state.},

The issue of swing voting is then brought to an environment where voters are rarely considered persuadable: Africa. Using a count-model estimation technique and original survey data from Ghana's critical 2008 elections, the analysis challenges the near consensus in African politics on clientelism as the only electoral strategy.When voters perceive politicians as providing collective, developmental goods, the efficacy of clientelism as a tool to win over voters is reduced.Many persuadable voters can also be won over by both clientelistic and collective goods, thus contradicting the literature presenting these as mutually exclusive. Finally, the analysis shows that incumbents do better when they provide collective goods even in highly clientelistic environments.},

  abstract = {Background: Medically uninsured patients seeking nonemergency care are not guaranteed access to services at most healthcare insti- tutions. They must first register with a clerk who could require a deposit and/or payment on an outstanding debt. Objectives: This study examines the factors that influence whether nonmedical bureaucratic staff sign in or turn away uninsured pa- tients who cannot meet prepayment requirements. Research Design: The study was conducted at a for-profit, a not-for-profit, and a public healthcare institution in a metropolitan area. The authors explored the relevant policy environment through interviews with senior administrators and a review of documents pertaining to the management of self-pay patients. Then they exam- ined how policies affecting access were implemented through in- depth, semistructured, audiotaped interviews with 55 front-line cler- ical personnel. Results: At all 3 institutions, policies were ambiguous about what to do when uninsured patients cannot afford required prepayments. Seventy-one percent of staff reported they do not turn patients away; the remainder stated that on occasion they do. A variety of rationales were provided for how decisions are made. Those with the lowest- level positions were significantly more likely to be sympathetic to indigent patients and less likely to report turning patients away. Conclusions: Consistent with other studies of front-line bureaucra- cies indicating that low-level personnel who interface with clients make discretionary decisions, particularly when organizations pur- sue potentially conflicting priorities, this preliminary investigation found that nonmedical personnel play a significant role in decisions affecting access to care for medically indigent patients},

Within this context, corruption was tolerated, sometimes even celebrated, as a means to lower-caste empowerment.},

In this sense, the political choices made at the state level are mostly ``principal'' and those made at the national level are increasingly ``derivative''. But state level politics shapes and filters rather than pre-determines the national outcome. Using this framework and the trends in 2004-09, this study attempts to understand the structure of contestation that will shape the final outcome in the coming Lok Sabha elections. The complex pattern of principal outcomes and timing in the political calendar shows that neither of the two major national alliances can sweep the polls nor be swept away in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. In all probability, we are going to witness one more election in which no single party or pre-poll alliance is likely to get a clear majority and one where the smallest of changes in individual states is likely to have a major impact on government formation in New Delhi.},

I examine the e\textcurrency ects of the infamous "hate radio" station Radio RTLM that called for the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic minority population before and dur- ing the 1994 Rwanda Genocide. I develop a model of participation in ethnic violence where radio broadcasts a noisy public signal about the value of violence. I then test the model's predictions using a nation-wide village-level dataset on radio coverage and prosecutions for genocide violence. To identify causal e\textcurrency ects, I exploit arguably exoge- nous variation in radio coverage generated by hills in the line-of-sight between radio transmitters and villages. Consistent with the model under strategic complements in violence, I ldotsnd that Radio RTLM increased participation in violence, that the e\textcurrency ects were decreasing in ethnic polarization, highly non-linear in radio coverage, and decreas- ing in literacy rates. Finally, the estimated e\textcurrency ects are substantial. Complete village radio coverage increased violence by 65 to 77 percent, and a simple counter-factual calculation suggests that approximately 9 percent of the genocide, corresponding to at least 45 000 Tutsi deaths, can be explained by the radio station.},

Frequently, the expansion of markets in education is presented by their promoters as a means to improve the opportunities of the most socio\- economically disadvantaged students. However, the evidence available shows that market-oriented policies that enhance competition and choice tend to produce negative effects on equity by boosting school segrega\- tion and social stratification among public and private schools. This paper aims to unpack the mechanisms through which market-oriented policies and the involvement of private actors in education can foster the uneven distribution of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. By using a mechanism-based explanation, this paper identifies and describes the functioning of three main mechanisms by which pro-market policies generate school segregation. Finally, the paper addresses the analytical benefits of the mechanism-based approach and reflects on its policy implications regarding market-oriented reforms in education.},

In three field studies of health and two of microlending, we randomly assigned subjects to be surveyed about health and/or household finances and then measured subsequent use of a related product with data that does not rely on subjects' self-reports. In the three health experiments, we find that being surveyed increases use of water treatment products and take-up of medical insurance. Frequent surveys on reported diarrhea also led to biased estimates of the impact of improved source water quality. In two microlending studies, we do not find an effect of being surveyed on borrowing behavior. The results suggest that limited attention could play an important but context-dependent role in consumer choice, with the implication that researchers should reconsider whether, how, and how much to survey their subjects.},
